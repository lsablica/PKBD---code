Short-term impacts of AIs or GBHs on earthworms are well known, but few studies have examined long-term legacy effects >3 months after application. In a pot experiment, we studied both short-term and long-term effects on deep burrowing earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris) and soil functions. Therefore, the cover crop Sinapis alba was grown in soils with either 3.0% or 4.1% soil organic matter content (SOM) and either sprayed with a GBH (Touchdown Quattro, Roundup PowerFlex, or Roundup LB Plus) or the respective glyphosate AI (diammonium-, potassium-, or isopropylamine-salt) or hand weeded (control). Long-term effects showed increased earthworm activity under GBHs even 4 months after application, but similar activity under AIs and control. Another application of the same treatments 5 months after the previous one also increased earthworm activity under GBHs, especially at high SOM levels. Water infiltration after a simulated heavy rainfall was 50% lower, and leaching was 30% higher under GBH than under AI application or hand weeding. Individual GBHs and AIs varied in their effects and were influenced by SOM and soil moisture. Full disclosure of all ingredients in GBH formulations would be necessary to allow a comprehensive assessment of environmental risks.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'The value of travel time savings (VTTS) representing the willingness to pay to reduce travel time, consists of two components: the value of liberating time [equal to the value of leisure (VoL)] and the value of time assigned to travel (VTAT), representing the travel conditions of a trip. Their relative values indicate which dimension to emphasize when investing in transport: speed or comfort. In this paper, we formulate and estimate a framework aimed at the improvement in the estimation of the VoL. By introducing a novel treatment of time assigned to domestic work, we consider that unpaid labor should be assigned a wage rate as a measure of the expenses avoided when assigning time to those chores. We use state-of-the-art data on time use and expenses as well as online data on gig workers collected in Austria, and apply the time-use and expenditure model of Jara-Diaz et al. (Transp Res Part B 42(10):946–957, 2008). The wage rates for paid and unpaid work were combined to re-formulate the budget constraint, which affected women more than men due to the higher involvement of the former in domestic activities. Compared against the original estimation, the VoL changed from €10/h for men and €6/h for women to €9/h for both genders, which in turn yields a larger average VTAT, which becomes positive for public transport. As a conclusion, the novel treatment of domestic labor contributes to closing the gap in the VoL between genders and highlights the power of unveiling the components behind the VTTS. The empirical findings imply that investments in travel time reductions rather than in comfort should be prioritized, given the very good conditions of public transport in Austria.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': ' The production of synthetic pesticides is energy intensive and can emit even more greenhouse gases (GHG) per kg than the production of synthetic fertilizers. However, this aspect is largely neglected when it comes to agriculture’s contribution to GHG emissions. Using official pesticide sales data from Austria from 2000 to 2019, we analyzed (i) trends in insecticide, fungicide, and herbicide use and calculated production-related GHG emissions, and (ii) the share of pesticide-related versus fertilizer-related GHG emissions in three agricultural crops with different pesticide intensities: sugar beets, apples, and grapevines. We found that between 2000 and 2019, insecticide amounts increased by 58%, fungicide amounts increased by 29%, and herbicide amounts decreased by 29%; associated GHG emissions showed similar patterns. During the same period, acreage under conventional arable crops, orchards, and vineyards decreased by an average of 19%, indicating an increase in management intensity. In intensive apple production, GHG emissions associated with pesticide production and application accounted for 51% of total GHG emissions, in viticulture 37%, and in sugar beets 12%. We have shown that GHG emissions due to pesticide production and application can be significant, especially for pesticide-intensive crops. We therefore recommend that these pesticide-derived GHG emissions should also be attributed to the agricultural sector.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'Background Pesticide use has been associated with risks for human health and an overall decline in biodiversity. Although herbicides are the most commonly used pesticides worldwide, they have received less attention in this debate. We investigated the extent to which long-term trends in herbicide use in Austria influence potential toxic exposures to non-target organisms and potential risks to humans. We analyzed official sales data of 101 herbicide active ingredients (AIs) approved in Austria between 2010 and 2019 regarding their ecotoxicological properties based on lethal doses (LD50 and LC50) weighed by their persistence in the environment (DT50) for honeybees (Apis mellifera), earthworms (Eisenia fetida), and birds (Serinus serinus). Human health risks were qualitatively assessed based on official hazard statements for the AIs used. Results In Austria, herbicide amounts sold decreased significantly by 24% from 1480 to 1123 tonnes between 2010 and 2019. This also led to a considerable decrease in the amounts of AIs classified by H-statements of the EU Pesticides Database: − 71% acute inhalation toxicity, − 58% reproductive toxicity,− 47% specific target organ toxicity. Yet, 36% of herbicides used were still classified as highly hazardous pesticides according to the Pesticide Action Network. Surprisingly, over the same period, toxic loads to honeybees increased by 487% (oral exposure), while lethal toxic loads to earthworms increased by 498%, and to birds by 580%. This can be attributed to a shift toward the use of more acutely toxic and especially more persistent AIs. The most problematic AI for honeybees, earthworms, birds and humans was the highly persistent diquat. The further ranking of the most toxic herbicides varied considerably depending on the organism. It is important to note that this toxic load assessment, like official environmental risk assessments, evaluates the potential risk but not the actual fatalities or real-world exposure. Conclusions Our results show a trade-off between herbicide amounts and toxicological hazards to humans and other non-target organisms. These interdependencies need to be considered when implementing pesticide reduction targets to protect public health and biodiversity, such as the EU´s “farm-to-fork” strategy, which aims to reduce the amounts and risks of synthetic pesticides.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'The invasive Spanish slug (Arion vulgaris) is an important pest species in agriculture and horticulture in Europe. In the last decades it has spread across the continent where it outcompetes native slug and snail species, thus posing a threat for biodiversity. A popular anecdote suggests to promote Roman snails (Helix pomatia) in gardens because they are able to control A. vulgaris. We examined a potential interrelationship between these two species using a mesocosm experiment with lettuce plants. 13C-15N stable isotope labelling of lettuce allowed us to investigate interactions between Helix and Arion on weight gain/loss and herbivory. Additionally, we wanted to know whether different watering regimes (daily vs. every 3rd day watering of weekly amount) and earthworms alter these interactions. Egg predation of Helix on Arion eggs was further tested in a food-choice experiment. Arion showed a five times higher herbivory per body mass than Helix in a single-species setting. However, in mesocosms containing both species percentage of herbivory per body mass was significantly lower than in Arion-only mesocosms, especially when watered every three days. Overall isotope uptake via eaten lettuce was unaffected by the presence of the other species. Only very little predation (three out of 200 eggs) of Helix on Arion eggs was observed. Our results provide no evidence for a clear dismissal or confirmation of the popular gardener’s anecdote that Helix snails have a negative effect on Arion abundance or herbivory.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'Wildlife-related accidents, especially deer-vehicle accidents, pose a serious problem for road safety and animal protection in many countries. Knowledge of spatial and temporal patterns of deer-vehicle accidents is inevitable for accident analysis and mitigation efforts with temporal deer-vehicle accident data being much more difficult to obtain in sufficient data quality. We described the temporal patterns of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) roadkills occurring in the period 2002–2006 in southeastern Austria. Using a comprehensive dataset, consisting of 11.771 data points, we examined the influence of different time units (i.e. season, month, day of week, day of year), illumination categories (coarse and fine temporal resolution) and lunar phases on deer-vehicle accidents by performing linear and generalized additive models. Thereby, we identified peak accident periods within the analyzed time units. Highest frequencies of deer-vehicle accidents occurred in November, May and October, on Fridays, and during nights. Relationships between lunar phases and roe deer-vehicle accidents were analysed, providing evidence for high frequencies of deer-vehicle accidents during full moon phases. We suggest that deer-vehicle accidents are dependent both on human activity in traffic and wildlife activity, which is in turn affected by phenology, intra- and interspecific competition, climatic and astronomical events. Our results highlight, that short-term mitigation measures (e.g. traffic controls and speed limits) can be highly effective to reduce deer-vehicle accidents, but should be flexibly adapted to specific temporal periods.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'Background Glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) are among the most often used pesticides. The hundreds of GBHs used worldwide consist of the active ingredient (AI) glyphosate in form of different salts, possibly other AIs, and various mostly undisclosed co-formulants. Pesticide risk assessments are commonly performed using single AIs or GBHs at standard soil conditions without vegetation. In a greenhouse experiment, we established a weed population with common amaranth (Amaranthus retroflexus) to examine the effects of three GBHs (Roundup LB Plus, Roundup PowerFlex, Touchdown Quattro) and their corresponding AIs (salts of glyphosate isopropylammonium, potassium, diammonium) on the activity and physiological biomarkers (glutathione S-transferase, GST; acetylcholine esterase, AChE) of an ecologically relevant earthworm species (Lumbricus terrestris). GBHs and AIs were applied at recommended doses; hand weeding served as control. Experiments were established with two soil types differing in organic matter content (SOM; 3.0% vs. 4.1%) and other properties. Results Earthworm activity (casting and movement activity) decreased after application of glyphosate formulations or active ingredients compared to hand weeding. We found no consistent pattern that formulations had either higher or lower effects on earthworm activity than their active ingredients; rather, differences were substance-specific. Earthworm activity was little affected by soil organic matter levels. Biomarkers remained unaffected by weed control types; GST but not AChE was decreased under high SOM. Water infiltration after a simulated heavy rainfall was interactively affected by weed control types and SOM. Leachate amount was higher after application of formulations than active ingredients and was higher under low SOM. Glyphosate concentrations in soil and leachate were strongly affected by application of formulations or active ingredients and varied with SOM (significant weed control type x SOM interaction). Conclusions We found that both commercial formulations and pure active ingredients can influence earthworms with consequences on important soil functions. Glyphosate products showed increased, reduced or similar effects than pure glyphosate on particular soil functions; soil properties can substantially alter this. Especially at lower SOM, heavy rainfalls could lead to more glyphosate leaching into water bodies. A full disclosure of co-formulants would be necessary to further decipher their specific contributions to these inconsistent effects.',\n",

The study presented in this paper demonstrates how the accuracy of certain indices can be significantly improved when calculated numerous times on data sets resampled from the original data. There are obviously many ways to resample data—in this study, three very common options are used: bootstrapping, data splitting (without subset overlap of two subsamples), and random subsetting (with subset overlap of two subsamples). Index values calculated on the basis of resampled data sets are compared to the values obtained from the original data partition. The primary hypothesis of the study states that resampling does generally improve index accuracy. The hypothesis is based on the notion of cluster stability: if there are stable clusters in a data set, a clustering algorithm should produce consistent results for data sampled or resampled from the same source. The primary hypothesis was partly confirmed; for external validation measures, it does indeed apply. The secondary hypothesis states that the resampling strategy itself does not play a significant role. This was also shown to be accurate, yet slight deviations between the resampling schemes suggest that splitting appears to yield slightly better results.',\n",

However, current wound infection models mostly use single-strain bacteria. To mimic clinically occurring infections caused by fecal contamination in immunocompromised/immobile patients, which differ significantly from single-strain infections, the present study aimed at the establishment of a new mouse model using infection by fecal bacteria. Dorsal circular excision wounds in immunosuppressed mice were infected with fecal slurry solution in several dilutions up to 1:8,000. Impact of immunosuppressor, bacterial load and timing on development of wound infections was investigated. Wounds were analyzed by scoring, 3D imaging and swab analyses.

Infection with fecal slurry diluted 1:166 to 1:400 induced significantly delayed wound healing (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05) without systemic reactions. Swab analyses post-infection matched the initial polymicrobial suspension. The customized wound score confirmed significant differences between the groups (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05).

Environmental risk assessments (ERA) on nontarget organisms mostly consider the active ingredients (AIs) of these herbicides, while much less is known on effects of commercial GBH formulations that are actually applied in the field. Moreover, it is largely unknown to what extent different soil characteristics alter potential side effects of herbicides. We conducted a greenhouse experiment growing a model weed population of Amaranthus retroflexus in arable field soil with either 3.0 or 4.1% soil organic matter (SOM) content and treated these weeds either with GBHs (Roundup LB Plus, Touchdown Quattro, Roundup PowerFlex) or their respective AIs (isopropylammonium, diammonium or potassium salts of glyphosate) at recommended dosages. Control pots were mechanically weeded. Nontarget effects were assessed on the surface activity of the springtail species Sminthurinus niger (pitfall trapping) and litter decomposition in the soil (teabag approach). Both GBHs and AIs increased the surface activity of springtails compared to control pots; springtail activity was higher under GBHs than under corresponding AIs. Stimulation of springtail activity was much higher in soil with higher SOM content than with low SOM content (significant treatment x SOM interaction).

Although it is simple and fast, as its name suggests, it nonetheless has neglected local optima and empty clusters that may arise. With the distance as an input to the algorithm, a generalized distance function is developed to increase the variation of the distances, especially for a mixed variable dataset. The variation of the distances is a crucial part of a partitioning algorithm due to different distances producing different outcomes. The experimental results of the simple k-medoids algorithm produce consistently good performances in various settings of mixed variable data.

This extended estimation takes into account multiple trips per individual, as well as mode availability. The model was estimated using the novel dataset gathered in Austria in 2015. It includes individual-specific information on time-use, expenditures and mode choice. As a result, we calculate the value of leisure (VoL), travel time savings (VTTS) and time assigned to travel (VTAT), that are relevant inputs to appraisals of transport policies. We also show that, at least for the Austrian working population, the omission of expenditures in the model might result in a significant overestimation of the value of leisure (16.83%); the VoL (9.29€/h) was estimated to be considerably lower than the wage rate (12.14€/h) and the VTTS varies strongly between the modes (9.98€/h for car, 3.91€/h for public transport, 9.25€/h for bike and 17.53€/h for walk). The joint estimation framework produced positive estimates of VTAT (5.38€/h) only for public transport, reflecting the favorable public transport conditions in Austria.',\n",

An online monitoring system for downstream processes is developed, which is based on an array of online detectors. Besides standard detectors (UV, pH, and conductivity), our chromatographic workstation is equipped with a fluorescence and a mid-infrared spectrometer, a light scattering, and a refractive index detector. The combination of these sensors enables the prediction of specific protein concentration and various purity attributes, such as high molecular weight impurities, DNA and host cell protein content during the elution phase of a chromatographic antibody capture process. Prediction models solely based on online signals are set up providing real-time predictions. No mechanistic models or information about the chromatographic runs is used. These predictions allow online pooling decisions replacing time- and labor-intensive laboratory measurements. Different process variations, such as changes in the column load or elution buffer, are introduced to test the predictive power of the models. Extrapolation of the models worked well when the column load is changed, whereas model adjustment is necessary when the elution conditions are changed considerably.',\n",

The goal is to ensure the quality of the final product. Currently, chromatographic processes in biopharmaceutical production are predominantly monitored with UV/Vis absorbance and a direct correlation with purity and quantity is limited. In this study, a chromatographic workstation was equipped with additional online sensors, such as multi-angle light scattering, refractive index, attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared, and fluorescence spectroscopy. Models to predict quantity, host cell proteins (HCP), and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) content simultaneously were developed and exemplified by a cation exchange capture step for fibroblast growth factor 2 expressed in Escherichia coliOnline data and corresponding offline data for product quantity and co-eluting impurities, such as dsDNA and HCP, were analyzed using boosted structured additive regression. Different sensor combinations were used to achieve the best prediction performance for each quality attribute. Quantity can be adequately predicted by applying a small predictor set of the typical chromatographic workstation sensor signals with a test error of 0.85 mg/ml (range in training data: 0.1–28 mg/ml). For HCP and dsDNA additional fluorescence and/or attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared spectral information was important to achieve prediction errors of 200 (2–6579 ppm) and 340 ppm (8–3773 ppm), respectively.',\n",

The parameters can be fitted with an EM algorithm. Alternatively, distance models based on the coefficients are used in the literature. Similar to the case of clustering multidimensional data, a variety of derivations of different models has been published. Although their calculation procedure is similar, their implementations are very different including distinct hyperparameters and data formats as input. This makes it difficult for the user to apply and particularly to compare them. Furthermore, they are mostly limited to specific basis functions. This paper aims to show the common elements between existing models in highly cited articles, first on a theoretical basis. Later their implementation is analyzed and it is illustrated how they could be improved and extended to a more general level.

A pre-requirement for their use in industrial production of biopharmaceuticals is to be clonal, thus originating from a single cell in order to be phenotypically and genomically identical. In the present study it was evaluated whether standard procedures, such as the generation of a recombinant cell line in combination with selection for a specific and stable phenotype (expression of the recombinant product) or subcloning have any impact on karyotype stability or homogeneity in CHO cells. Analyses used were the distribution of chromosome counts per cell as well as chromosome painting to identify specific karyotype patterns within a population. Results indicate that subclones both of the host and the recombinant cell line are of comparable heterogeneity and (in)stability as the original pool. In contrast, the rigorous selection for a stably expressing phenotype generated cell lines with fewer variation and more stable karyotypes, both at the level of the sorted pool and derivative subclones. We conclude that the process of subcloning itself does not contribute to an improved karyotypic homogeneity of a population, while the selection for a specific cell property inherently can provide evolutionary pressure that may lead to improved chromosomal stability as well as to a more homogenous population.',\n",

CHO-S, CHO-K1 8\\u2009mM glutamine, and CHO-K1 cells adapted to grow in media containing no glutamine were analyzed over up to 6 months in culture.

Chromosome Painting revealed a predominant karyotype for each cell line at the start of the experiment, completed by a large number of variants present in each population. Over time in culture, the predominant karyotype changed for CHO-S and CHO-K1, with the diversity increasing and new variants appearing, while CHO-K1 0\\u2009mM Gln preferred chromosome pattern increased in percent of the population over time.

Many individuals think about foster caring long before they actually become carers, and it stands to reason that in many cases, carer discontinuation also follows a period of ideation. This being the case, it is possible that by monitoring ideation, interventions could be introduced to prevent placement disruptions occurring, particularly if the sources of dissatisfaction are known. Using a sample of 205 foster carers, a posteriori segmentation analysis identifies groups of carers dissatisfied with the same aspects of their role. One group is particularly dissatisfied with factors that are within the control of foster care agencies and also reports high levels of discontinuation ideation. Recommendations include that the individual support needs of carers be identified such that customized support can be offered, including boosting initial and ongoing training to manage expectations and ensure carers feel prepared for the role.

Special emphasis is put on historical functional effects, where functional response and functional covariate are observed over the same interval and the response is only influenced by covariate values up to the current grid point. Historical functional effects are mostly used when functional response and covariate are observed on a common time interval, as they account for chronology. Our formulation allows for flexible integration limits including, e.g., lead or lag times. The functional responses can be observed on irregular curve-specific grids. Additionally, we introduce different parameterizations for historical effects and discuss identifiability issues.The models are estimated by a component-wise gradient boosting algorithm which is suitable for models with a potentially high number of covariate effects, even more than observations, and inherently does model selection. By minimizing corresponding loss functions, different features of the conditional response distribution can be modeled, including generalized and quantile regression models as special cases. The methods are implemented in the open-source R package FDboost. The methodological developments are motivated by biotechnological data on Escherichia coli fermentations, but cover a much broader model class.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'Background Several studies indicate associations between early growth and type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, it remains an open question whether these findings can be translated to typical growth patterns associated with increased risk for T1D-associated islet autoimmunity. Methods We analyzed pooled data from 2236 children followed up in two large prospective German birth cohorts with a genetically increased risk for T1D including 18\\u2009564 measurements of height and weight, which were transformed to sex- and age-specific standard deviation scores (SDS). A total of 191 children developed any islet autoantibodies, 101 multiple islet autoantibodies. We applied a model-based clustering technique to derive typical height and body mass index (BMI) growth patterns, stratified for maternal T1D status. These patterns were used to predict islet autoimmunity in logistic regression models, adjusted for potential confounders. Results Growth patterns were not associated with islet autoimmunity in the whole dataset and in children of diabetic mothers, respectively. In children of non-diabetic mothers ,however, islet autoimmunity was associated with rapidly increasing BMI SDS values until the age of 3\\u2009yr [adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 2.02 (1.03, 3.73) for development of any islet autoantibodies) and with consistently above average height SDS values [odds ratio: 2.21 (1.15, 4.17)]. In contrast, a pattern of high height SDS values at birth followed by a decrease to average values after 3\\u2009yr was associated with a reduced rate of islet autoimmunity [odds ratio: 0.16 (0.01, 0.62)].

       "  {'abstract': \" The quality of biopharmaceuticals and patients' safety are of highest priority and there are tremendous efforts to replace empirical production process designs by knowledge-based approaches. Main challenge in this context is that real-time access to process variables related to product quality and quantity is severely limited. To date comprehensive on- and offline monitoring platforms are used to generate process data sets that allow for development of mechanistic and/or data driven models for real-time prediction of these important quantities. Ultimate goal is to implement model based feed-back control loops that facilitate online control of product quality. In this contribution, we explore structured additive regression (STAR) models in combination with boosting as a variable selection tool for modeling the cell dry mass, product concentration, and optical density on the basis of online available process variables and two-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopic data. STAR models are powerful extensions of linear models allowing for inclusion of smooth effects or interactions between predictors. Boosting constructs the final model in a stepwise manner and provides a variable importance measure via predictor selection frequencies. Our results show that the cell dry mass can be modeled with a relative error of about ±3%, the optical density with ±6%, the soluble protein with ±16%, and the insoluble product with an accuracy of ±12%.

       "  {'abstract': 'Visiting friends and relatives (VFR) contributes significantly to tourism activity and revenues, accounting for about 48 percent of domestic travel in Australia. Implicit in most discussions of VFR travel is that it represents one homogeneous market. This paper examines this assumption and demonstrates – based on data from 67,024 domestic and international tourists to Australia – that this is not the case. The profile of people visiting friends (VFs) differs significantly from that of people visiting relatives (VRs). This finding has major implications for tourism marketing which need to target VFs or VRs in distinctly different ways, rather than generically marketing to VFR travellers.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'Theoretical knowledge of clustering functions is still scarce and only few models are available in form of applicable code. In literature, most methods are based on the projection of the functions onto a basis and building fixed or random effects models of the basis coefficients. They involve various parameters, among them number of basis functions, projection dimension, number of iterations etc. They usually work well on the data presented in the articles, but their performance has in most cases not been tested objectively on other data sets, nor against each other. The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of several existing methods to cluster functional data. An outline of their theoretic concepts is given and the meaning of their hyperparameters is explained. A simulation study was set up to analyze the parameters’ efficiency and sensitivity on different types of data sets, that were registered on regular and on irregular grids. For each method, a linear model of the clustering results was evaluated with different parameter levels as predictors. Later, the methods’ performances were compared to each other with the help of a visualization tool, to identify which method works the best on a specific kind of data.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'Misalignment of pro-environmental beliefs and environmentally unsustainable vacation behaviour can cause psychological tension to tourists. They manage this tension by finding justifications for their behaviour, rather than changing their behaviour. A recent study has systematized such justification; this systematics is used in the present study to investigate the existence of tourist segment sharing justification patterns. A finite mixture model with concomitant variables is used to analyse 2785 survey responses. Three segments are identified. The government blamers express strong interest in the environmental sustainability of their vacation, but deny both their responsibility and ability to make a difference. The struggling seekers would not book their dream vacation if it was environmentally unfriendly, yet do not feel in control of reducing negative environmental impacts of their holiday, which they fully acknowledge. The impact neglecters also state they would not book their dream vacation if it was environmentally unfriendly, but their main justification for taking – potentially environmentally harmful – vacations is denial of the negative environmental consequences of tourism. The existence of these differences in justification patterns indicates different approaches could counteract each of these segment-specific beliefs by inducing cognitive dissonance, shown in other contexts to induce behavioural change. Advice on approaches is given.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'Product quality assurance strategies in production of biopharmaceuticals currently undergo a transformation from empirical “quality by testing” to rational, knowledge-based “quality by design” approaches. The major challenges in this context are the fragmentary understanding of bioprocesses and the severely limited real-time access to process variables related to product quality and quantity. Data driven modeling of process variables in combination with model predictive process control concepts represent a potential solution to these problems. The selection of statistical techniques best qualified for bioprocess data analysis and modeling is a key criterion. In this work a series of recombinant Escherichia coli fed-batch production processes with varying cultivation conditions employing a comprehensive on- and offline process monitoring platform was conducted. The applicability of two machine learning methods, random forest and neural networks, for the prediction of cell dry mass and recombinant protein based on online available process parameters and two-dimensional multi-wavelength fluorescence spectroscopy is investigated. Models solely based on routinely measured process variables give a satisfying prediction accuracy of about ± 4% for the cell dry mass, while additional spectroscopic information allows for an estimation of the protein concentration within ± 12%. The results clearly argue for a combined approach: neural networks as modeling technique and random forest as variable selection tool.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'An in-depth understanding of travel behaviour determinants, including the relationship to non-travel activities, is the foundation for modelling and policy making. National Travel Surveys (NTS) and time use surveys (TUS) are two major data sources for travel behaviour and activity participation. The aim of this paper is to systematically compare both survey types regarding travel activities and non-travel activities. The analyses are based on the German National Travel Survey and the German National Time Use Survey from 2002. The number of trips and daily travel time for mobile respondents were computed as the main travel estimates. The number of trips per person is higher in the German TUS when changes in location without a trip are included. Location changes without a trip are consecutive non-trip activities with different locations but without a trip in-between. The daily travel time is consistently higher in the German TUS. The main reason for this difference is the 10-min interval used. Differences in travel estimates between the German TUS and NTS result from several interaction effects. Activity time in NTS is comparable with TUS for subsistence activities. Our analyses confirm that both survey types have advantages and disadvantages. TUS provide reliable travel estimates. The number of trips even seems preferable to NTS if missed trips are properly identified and considered. Daily travel times are somewhat exaggerated due to the 10-min interval. The fixed time interval is the most important limitation of TUS data. The result is that trip times in TUS do not represent actual trip times very well and should be treated with caution. We can use NTS activity data for subsistence activities between the first trip and the last trip. This can potentially benefit activity-based approaches since most activities before the first trip and after the last trip are typical home-based activities which are rarely substituted by out-of-home activities.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': \"Accessibility in rural Austrian areas is more restricted than in urban regions. Limited accessibility leads to social exclusion. Therefore, mobility should be inclusive, allowing everyone to satisfy mobility needs and reach destinations. Mobility should also be environmentally friendly. Use of a private car offers opportunities for comprehensive mobility but is related with high individual, social, and environmental costs. We studied the interplay between employment, care, and mobility variables among people in the foothills of the European Alps in Lower Austria who are employed and have care responsibilities, assuming them to be a group with complex mobility needs and high vulnerability. The aim was to derive policy recommendations to decrease their car dependency and ensure accessibility. Adopting a mixed methods approach, we conducted a tailored quantitative and qualitative survey, using cluster analysis to derive relevant patterns. Within the group under analysis, 5 subgroups were identified: persons in 2 clusters worked more and cared less, with significant differences in commuting distances. Persons of 2 further clusters cared more and worked less, with one group caring for very young children, and the other working and caring a lot. Persons in the fifth cluster cared for elderly people, had low caring duties, and almost no pickup/drop-off trips; almost all had full-time jobs. Significant gender differences existed in the identified activity patterns. Results showed that responsibility for care is still mainly with women, even if they are increasingly seeking employment. Recommendations in 3 major fields of action were derived, comprising: measures to support the mobility of persons responsible for care, measures to support the autonomy of cared persons' mobility, and measures to reduce the mobility needs of both groups. Even if respondents are satisfied with how they manage their care tasks and employment by car, higher shares of walking, cycling, and public transport seem to be necessary and feasible.\",\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'Objectives: Cognitive behavioural guided self-help has been shown to be effective in mild and moderate depressive disorder. It is not known, however, if it is effective in individuals with partially remitted depressive disorder, which is a serious clinical problem in up to 50-60% of treated patients. This study is the first one to examine the clinical benefit of this intervention in this patient population. Design: For the purpose of this study, a single-blind, randomized controlled design was used. Method: We randomized 90 individuals with partially remitted depressive disorder either to cognitive behavioural guided self-help plus psychopharmacotherapy (n = 49) or psychopharmacotherapy alone (n = 41). They were clinically assessed at regular intervals with ratings of depressive symptoms and stress-coping strategies over a 3-week run-in period and a 6-week treatment period. Results: After 6 weeks, intention-to-treat analysis (n = 90) showed that patients treated with cognitive behavioural guided self-help plus psychopharmacotherapy did not have significantly lower scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale of Depression (17-item version; HRSD-17) and on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) compared to patients treated with psychopharmacotherapy alone. When negative stress-coping strategies were considered, there was a significant difference between the two groups at the end of treatment with respect to the BDI but not to the HRSD-17. Conclusions: Guided self-help did not lead to a significant reduction in symptom severity in patients with partially remitted depressive disorder after a 6-week intervention. However, the intervention leads to a reduction of negative stress-coping strategies. Practitioner points: Cognitive behavioural guided self-help did not significantly improve depressive symptoms measured with the Hamilton Rating Scale of Depression (17-item version; HRSD-17) in patients with partially remitted depressive disorder. Improvements were found in reducing negative stress-coping strategies for those allocated to the cognitive behavioural guided self-help, which significantly improved Beck Depression Inventory but not HRSD-17. These findings suggest that cognitive behavioural guided self-help may offer some assistance in managing negative stress-coping strategies.',\n",

With this method a further improvement of the misclassification error in the aforementioned instrument recognition task is possible. Using order constrained K-means the musical structure of a whole piece of popular music can be extracted automatically. Visualizing the distances of the feature vectors through a self distance matrix allows for an easy visual verification of the result.

       "  {'abstract': 'The increasing number of deer–vehicle-accidents (DVAs) and the resulting economic costs have promoted numerous studies on behavioural and environmental factors which may contribute to the quantity, spatiotemporal distribution and characteristics of DVAs. Contrary to the spatial pattern of DVAs, data of their temporal pattern is scarce and difficult to obtain because of insufficient accuracy in available datasets, missing standardization in data aquisition, legal terms and low reporting rates to authorities. Literature of deer–traffic collisions on roads and railways is reviewed to examine current understanding of DVA temporal trends. Seasonal, diurnal and lunar peak accident periods are identified for deer, although seasonal pattern are not consistent among and within species or regions and data on effects of lunar cycles on DVAs is almost non-existent. Cluster analysis of seasonal DVA data shows nine distinct clusters of different seasonal DVA pattern for cervid species within the reviewed literature. Studies analyzing the relationship between time-related traffic predictors and DVAs yield mixed results. Despite the seasonal dissimilarity, diurnal DVA pattern are comparatively constant in deer, resulting in pronounced DVA peaks during the hours of dusk and dawn frequently described as bimodal crepuscular pattern. Behavioural aspects in activity seem to have the highest impact in DVAs temporal trends. Differences and variations are related to habitat-, climatic- and traffic characteristics as well as effects of predation, hunting and disturbance. Knowledge of detailed temporal DVA pattern is essential for prevention management as well as for the application and evaluation of mitigation measures.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'It is common knowledge that the performance of different learning algorithms depends on certain characteristics of the data—such as dimensionality, linear separability or sample size. However, formally investigating this relationship in an objective and reproducible way is not trivial. A new formal framework for describing the relationship between data set characteristics and the performance of different learning algorithms is proposed. The framework combines the advantages of benchmark experiments with the formal description of data set characteristics by means of statistical and information-theoretic measures and with the recursive partitioning of Bradley–Terry models for comparing the algorithms’ performances. The formal aspects of each component are introduced and illustrated by means of an artificial example. Its real-world usage is demonstrated with an application example consisting of thirteen widely-used data sets and six common learning algorithms. The Appendix provides information on the implementation and the usage of the framework within the R language.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'With increasing numbers of non-profit organizations and higher demand for a wider range of social services, the need for volunteers has never been greater. There is general agreement that competition within the sector is increasing, and this has led to organizations placing greater emphasis on building strong brand images to differentiate themselves from competitors. However, there are also many instances where non-profits have successfully collaborated with each other to achieve efficiencies and meet objectives. The purpose of this exploratory study is to examine, which of these approaches – competition or collaboration – is more appropriate for the challenge of volunteer recruitment. We use data from an empirical study of 1415 Australians to investigate whether, based on perceived organizational brand images, volunteering organizations compete with each other for volunteers or are seen as complimentary. Results indicate that while consideration of organizations with certain brand images – especially the Heroes image – means that donation of time to other volunteering organizations is unlikely, other organizational brand images, such as that of being a local volunteering organization or one that provides support to people experiencing difficulty are likely to be compatible, opening up valuable opportunities for collaborative marketing for the purpose of volunteer recruitment.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'Data evaluation is a crucial step when it comes to the determination of accurate and precise isotope ratios computed from transient signals measured by multi-collector–inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICPMS) coupled to, for example, laser ablation (LA). In the present study, the applicability of different data evaluation strategies (i.e. ‘point-by-point’, ‘integration’ and ‘linear regression slope’ method) for the computation of 235U/238U isotope ratios measured in single particles by LA-MC-ICPMS was investigated. The analyzed uranium oxide particles (i.e. 9073-01-B, CRM U010 and NUSIMEP-7 test samples), having sizes down to the sub-micrometre range, are certified with respect to their 235U/238U isotopic signature, which enabled evaluation of the applied strategies with respect to precision and accuracy. The different strategies were also compared with respect to their expanded uncertainties. Even though the ‘point-by-point’ method proved to be superior, the other methods are advantageous, as they take weighted signal intensities into account. For the first time, the use of a ‘finite mixture model’ is presented for the determination of an unknown number of different U isotopic compositions of single particles present on the same planchet. The model uses an algorithm that determines the number of isotopic signatures by attributing individual data points to computed clusters. The 235U/238U isotope ratios are then determined by means of the slopes of linear regressions estimated for each cluster. The model was successfully applied for the accurate determination of different 235U/238U isotope ratios of particles deposited on the NUSIMEP-7 test samples.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': \"Purpose Academic researchers love multi‐category answer formats, especially five‐ and seven‐point formats. More than a decade ago Josef Mazanec concluded that these formats may not the best choice, and that simple binary‐answer options are preferable in some empirical survey contexts. The purpose of the present study is to investigate empirically Mazanec's hypothesis in the context of the measurement of evaluative beliefs relating to fast‐food restaurants. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted an online experiment that asked respondents to assess evaluative beliefs relating to fast‐food brands using either a forced binary (n=100) or a seven‐point answer format (n=100). The authors also measured preferences for each of the fast‐food restaurants, user friendliness, and recorded the actual completion times for the survey. Findings The results indicate that the full binary answer format outperforms the popular seven‐point multi‐category format with respect to stability, concurrent validity, and speed of completion. Practical implications Given the demonstrated strengths of full binary measures, they should be used more by both practitioners and academics when measuring evaluative beliefs. Originality/value This study provides empirical evidence of the strong performance of the forced binary‐answer format for the measurement of evaluative beliefs, and thus challenges current measurement practice among academics and practitioners.\",\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'The human lens nucleus is formed in utero, and from birth onwards, there appears to be no significant turnover of intracellular proteins or membrane components. Since, in adults, this region also lacks active enzymes, it offers the opportunity to examine the intrinsic stability of macromolecules under physiological conditions. Fifty seven human lenses, ranging in age from 12 to 82 years, were dissected into nucleus and cortex, and the nuclear lipids analyzed by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. In the first four decades of life, glycerophospholipids (with the exception of lysophosphatidylethanolamines) declined rapidly, such that by age 40, their content became negligible. In contrast the level of ceramides and dihydroceramides, which were undetectable prior to age 30, increased approximately 100-fold. The concentration of sphingomyelins and dihydrosphingomyelins remained unchanged over the whole life span. As a consequence of this marked alteration in composition, the properties of fiber cell membranes in the centre of young lenses are likely to be very different from those in older lenses. Interestingly, the identification of age 40 years as a time of transition in the lipid composition of the nucleus coincides with previously reported macroscopic changes in lens properties (e.g., a massive age-related increase in lens stiffness) and related pathologies such as presbyopia. The underlying reasons for the dramatic change in the lipid profile of the human lens with age are not known, but are most likely linked to the stability of some membrane lipids in a physiological environment.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'Previous studies noted significant health and behavioural problems in cattle accommodated on fully slatted floors. As the majority of beef bulls in Austria are still housed on fully slatted floors the development of alternative housing systems becomes vitally important. On the basis of behavioural analyses, we wanted to test the suitability of alternative housing systems under on-farm conditions. Data was collected on seven Austrian farms between January 2006 and April 2007. The resting, social and sexual behaviour of 219 Simmental bulls accommodated in four different housing systems was observed for 48 h at an average live weight of 450 kg and 600 kg using continuous and scan sampling method. The studied housing systems were (a) fully concrete slatted floor pens (CS), (b) fully slatted floor pens covered with rubber mats (RS), (c) straw bedded pens (ST) and (d) a system combining straw bedded pens (for bulls weighing less than 450 kg) and fully slatted floor pens (for bulls weighing more than 450 kg), (SS). The number of lying (P > 0.001) and short standing bouts (P < 0.001) was significantly higher in ST and RS than in CS and the mean duration of lying bouts significantly lower (P < 0.001). Bulls in ST showed less atypical lying down movements and difficulties to stand up than bulls in the other systems (P < 0.001). The number of lying down intentions was significantly lower in ST and RS than in CS (P < 0.001). Moreover, we found a significantly lower mean duration of lying down (P = 0.005) and standing up (P < 0.001) in ST than in CS and SS. It is concluded that rubber mats for slatted floors have a positive effect on the bulls’ behaviour but do not reach the welfare potential of straw bedding.',\n",

Here, a general class of Rasch mixture models is established and implemented in R, using conditional maximum likelihood estimation of the item parameters (given the raw scores) along with flexible specification of two model building blocks: (1) Mixture weights for the unobserved classes can be treated as model parameters or based on covariates in a concomitant variable model. (2) The distribution of raw score probabilities can be parametrized in two possible ways, either using a saturated model or a specification through mean and variance. The function raschmix() in the R package psychomix provides these models, leveraging the general infrastructure for fitting mixture models in the flexmix package.

This method is independent of rigid model forms or other link functions. It may be applied both to metric and non-metric data as well as to independent or matched parallel samples. With this method identification of the most relevant biomarkers is not based on inferential methods; therefore, its application does not require corrections of the level of significance, even in cases of thousands of variables. Hence, the introduced method is appropriate to analyze and evaluate data of complex investigations in clinical and pre-clinical basic research, such as gene or protein expressions, phenotype-genotype associations in case-control studies on the basis of thousands of genes and SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphism), search of prevalence in sleep EEG-Data, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or others.',\n",

It aims to identify market segments among tourists who are similar to each other, thus allowing a targeted marketing mix to be developed. Typically data used to segment tourists are characterized by small numbers of respondents and large numbers of survey questions. Small samples and numerous questions cause serious methodological problems that have typically been addressed by using factor-cluster analysis to reduce the dimensionality of data. Recently, factor-cluster analysis has been shown as an unacceptable solution to the problem of high data dimensionality in segmentation. In this article, the authors introduce biclustering, a novel approach to address the problem of high dimensionality in tourism segmentation studies. We discuss the circumstances in which biclustering should be used rather than parametric or nonparametric grouping techniques. An illustrative example of how biclustering is computed is also provided.',\n",

For collections of data sets, the empirical performance distributions of a set of learning algorithms are estimated, compared, and ordered. Usually this is done for each data set separately. The present manuscript extends this single data set-based approach to a joint analysis for the complete collection, the so called problem domain. This enables to decide which algorithms to deploy in a specific application or to compare newly developed algorithms with well-known algorithms on established problem domains. Specialized visualization methods allow for easy exploration of huge amounts of benchmark data. Furthermore, we take the benchmark experiment design into account and use mixed-effects models to provide a formal statistical analysis. Two domain-based benchmark experiments demonstrate our methods: the UCI domain as a well-known domain when one is developing a new algorithm; and the Grasshopper domain as a domain where we want to find the  best learning algorithm for a prediction component in an enterprise application software system.',\n",

Market researchers thus face the challenge of recruiting respondents, increasing response rates and reducing respondent fatigue by making questionnaires as short and pleasant as possible. One way of achieving this is to replace traditionally used ordinal multi-category answer formats (such as Likert-type scales) with forced binary scales. This proposition is attractive only if it indeed shortens the survey time while not compromising the quality of managerial insights from the data. This study investigates these conditions. Results from a repeat-measurement design indicate that managerial interpretations do not differ substantially between the two answer formats, responses are equally reliable, and that the binary format is quicker and perceived as less complex.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'This paper answers key questions about personal and industry decision-making in implementing sustainable tourism. Being environmentally friendly is typically associated with sacrifice, including sacrifice of comfort (e.g. walking rather than driving), sacrifice of time (e.g. recycling garbage) or sacrifice of money (e.g. buying more expensive locally grown vegetables). Consequently, the tourism industry perceives sustainable tourism as a sacrificial touristic niche, one that is associated with additional cost but appears to attract customers who do not spend enough money to compensate for the extra effort. This paper explores a perceived trade-off between minimising environmental damage and maximising revenue, by finding market segments that are environmentally friendly and have high expenditures. An online survey was made of 1003 Australian domestic tourists. Results indicate that tourist segments vary significantly in terms of their environmental impacts and vacation expenditure. Six segments were identified. Two market segments, containing 40% of the total market, that leave small environmental footprints while maintaining high expenditure were found, indicating that market segmentation when coupled with marketing/demarketing policies can be used as a strategy complementary to the development of destination-based initiatives to reduce the environmental impact of tourism.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'Background Several DNA microarray based expression signatures for the different clinically relevant thyroid tumor entities have been described over the past few years. However, reproducibility of these signatures is generally low, mainly due to study biases, small sample sizes and the highly multivariate nature of microarrays. While there are new technologies available for a more accurate high throughput expression analysis, we show that there is still a lot of information to be gained from data deposited in public microarray databases. In this study we were aiming (1) to identify potential markers for papillary thyroid carcinomas through meta analysis of public microarray data and (2) to confirm these markers in an independent dataset using an independent technology. Methods We adopted a meta analysis approach for four publicly available microarray datasets on papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) nodules versus nodular goitre (NG) from N2-frozen tissue. The methodology included merging of datasets, bias removal using distance weighted discrimination (DWD), feature selection/inference statistics, classification/crossvalidation and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). External Validation was performed on an independent dataset using an independent technology, quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) in our laboratory. Results From meta analysis we identified one gene (SERPINA1) which identifies papillary thyroid carcinoma against benign nodules with 99% accuracy (n = 99, sensitivity = 0.98, specificity = 1, PPV = 1, NPV = 0.98). In the independent validation data, which included not only PTC and NG, but all major histological thyroid entities plus a few variants, SERPINA1 was again markedly up regulated (36-fold, p = 1:3*10-10) in PTC and identification of papillary carcinoma was possible with 93% accuracy (n = 82, sensitivity = 1, specificity = 0.90, PPV = 0.76, NPV = 1). We also show that the extracellular matrix pathway is strongly activated in the meta analysis data, suggesting an important role of tumor-stroma interaction in the carcinogenesis of papillary thyroid carcinoma. Conclusions We show that valuable new information can be gained from meta analysis of existing microarray data deposited in public repositories. While single microarray studies rarely exhibit a sample number which allows robust feature selection, this can be achieved by combining published data using DWD. This approach is not only efficient, but also very cost-effective. Independent validation shows the validity of the results from this meta analysis and confirms SERPINA1 as a potent mRNA marker for PTC in a total (meta analysis plus validation) of 181 samples.',\n",

We found a nominally significant association between gender and harm avoidance (P=0.017; women showing higher scores). There was no association of either DAT1, DRD3 or 5HT2A alleles or genotypes with any dimension of the TCI applying Kruskal–Wallis rank-sum tests. Comparing homozygote and heterozygote DAT1 genotypes, we found higher novelty seeking scores in homozygotes (P=0.054). We further found a nominally significant interaction between DAT1 and 5HT2A homo-/heterozygous gene variants (P=0.0071; DAT1 and 5HT2A genotypes P value of 0.05), performing multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Examining the temperamental TCI subscales, this interaction was associated with persistence (genotypes: P=0.004; homo-/heterozygous gene variants: P=0.0004).

As the majority of beef bulls in Austria are still housed on fully slatted floors the development of alternative housing systems becomes vitally important. On the basis of behavioural analyses, we wanted to test the suitability of alternative housing systems under on-farm conditions. Data was collected on seven Austrian farms between January 2006 and April 2007. The resting, social and sexual behaviour of 219 Simmental bulls accommodated in four different housing systems was observed for 48 h at an average live weight of 450 kg and 600 kg using continuous and scan sampling method. The studied housing systems were (a) fully concrete slatted floor pens (CS), (b) fully slatted floor pens covered with rubber mats (RS), (c) straw bedded pens (ST) and (d) a system combining straw bedded pens (for bulls weighing less than 450 kg) and fully slatted floor pens (for bulls weighing more than 450 kg), (SS). The number of lying (P > 0.001) and short standing bouts (P < 0.001) was significantly higher in ST and RS than in CS and the mean duration of lying bouts significantly lower (P < 0.001). Bulls in ST showed less atypical lying down movements and difficulties to stand up than bulls in the other systems (P < 0.001). The number of lying down intentions was significantly lower in ST and RS than in CS (P < 0.001). Moreover, we found a significantly lower mean duration of lying down (P = 0.005) and standing up (P < 0.001) in ST than in CS and SS. It is concluded that rubber mats for slatted floors have a positive effect on the bulls’ behaviour but do not reach the welfare potential of straw bedding.',\n",

Interdisciplinary cooperation and concerted development of software-tools for simplified and accelerated data analysis and interpretation is the key to overcome the bottleneck in data-analysis workflows. This approach is exemplified by gcExplorer an interactive visualization toolbox based on cluster analysis. Clustering is an important tool in gene expression data analysis to find groups of co-expressed genes which can finally suggest functional pathways and interactions between genes. The visualization of gene clusters gives practitioners an understanding of the cluster structure of their data and makes it easier to interpret the cluster results. Results: In this study the interactive visualization toolbox gcExplorer is applied to the interpretation of E. coli microarray data. The data sets derive from two fedbatch experiments conducted in order to investigate the impact of different induction strategies on the host metabolism and product yield. The software enables direct graphical comparison of these two experiments. The identification of potentially interesting gene candidates or functional groups is substantially accelerated and eased. Conclusion: It was shown that gcExplorer is a very helpful tool to gain a general overview of microarray experiments. Interesting gene expression patterns can easily be found, compared among different experiments and combined with information about gene function from publicly available databases.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'Background Many different cluster methods are frequently used in gene expression data analysis to find groups of co-expressed genes. However, cluster algorithms with the ability to visualize the resulting clusters are usually preferred. The visualization of gene clusters gives practitioners an understanding of the cluster structure of their data and makes it easier to interpret the cluster results. Results In this paper recent extensions of R package gcExplorer are presented. gcExplorer is an interactive visualization toolbox for the investigation of the overall cluster structure as well as single clusters. The different visualization options including arbitrary node and panel functions are described in detail. Finally the toolbox can be used to investigate the quality of a given clustering graphically as well as theoretically by testing the association between a partition and a functional group under study. Conclusion It is shown that gcExplorer is a very helpful tool for a general exploration of microarray experiments. The identification of potentially interesting gene candidates or functional groups is substantially accelerated and eased. Inferential analysis on a cluster solution is used to judge its ability to provide insight into the underlying mechanistic biology of the experiment.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'Background Gene copy number and gene expression values play important roles in cancer initiation and progression. Both can be measured with high-throughput microarrays and some methodologies to integrate and analyze these data exist. However, varying gene sets within different gene expression and copy number microarrays present significant challenges. Results We report an advanced version of earlier published CGH-Plotter that rapidly can identify amplified and deleted areas using gene copy number data. With CGH-Plotter v2, the copy number values can be filtered based on the genomic location in basepair units. After filtering, the values for the missing genes can be interpolated. Moreover, the effect of non-informative areas in the genome can be systematically removed by smoothing and interpolating. Further, we developed a tool (ECN) to illustrate the CGH-data values annotated based on the gene expression. The ECN-tool is a MATLAB toolbox enabling straightforward illustration of copy numbers annotated based on the gene expression levels. Conclusion CGH-Plotter v2 provides two methods for analyzing copy number data; dynamic programming and genomic location based smoothing. With ECN-tool the data analyzed with CGH-Plotter v2 can easily be illustrated along the chromosomes individually or along the whole genome. ECN-tool plots the copy number data annotated based on the gene expression data, and it is easy to find the genes that are both over-expressed and amplified or under-expressed and deleted in the samples. From the resulting figures it is straightforward to select interesting genes.',\n",

Authors have proposed a demand-driven approach to sustainable destination management as complementary to traditional supply-side interventions. However, little empirical evidence supports the feasibility of such a demand-driven approach. This study contributes to this gap by investigating whether individuals who feel morally obliged to behave in an environmentally friendly manner represent useful target segments for destination management aiming to improve the ecological sustainability of the local tourism industry. Results indicate that distinctly different moral obligation segments exist that differ in pro-environmental behavior and attitudes. These segments are associated with distinctly different vacation preferences and can consequently be used by destination management for target marketing. Gaps between people's pro-environmental behavior at home and at the destination systematically differ across segments, leading to the conclusion that different combinations of demand and supply-side measures may be suitable to reduce the environmental footprint of different segments.\",\n",

Consequently, destination managers are under increased pressure to implement ecologically sustainable practices. Selective targeting of tourists has been proposed as one approach to sustainable destination management, but the feasibility of this approach remains untested. Therein lies the contribution of this study. Results from a survey of 1000 Australians indicated that market segments based on past environmentally friendly behaviour at the destination represent distinct groups with respect to psychographic, behavioural and socio-demographic personal characteristics. These explanatory variables contributed substantially to explaining pro-environmental behaviour. It was concluded that selective target marketing represents a feasible complement to current sustainable tourism management techniques which focus on tourists at the destination who may not necessarily be interested in protecting the local environment.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'From observations of intra-specific social grooming in cattle and studies on human stroking in other species, we hypothesised that cows’ reactions to human stroking differ depending on the body regions being stroked. Moreover, we tested, whether cows ‘reactions to stroking change with the animals’ experience of stroking. Sixty dairy cows were stroked in three different body regions, i.e. the withers, W, neck ventral, NV (both licked often in social grooming) and the lateral chest, LC (licked rarely), in a balanced order during 10-min sessions. Behavioural reactions and heart rate during stroking as well as reactions to the human just after stroking were recorded. Two test sessions were carried out with 3 weeks of treatment in-between. During this period, the cows were randomly allocated to four treatment groups: three groups received 5 min of daily stroking in either W, NV or LC and the last one (control group) was exposed to simple human presence. During stroking W and NV, cows showed longer neck stretching and ear hanging than during stroking LC (P < 0.001). Moreover, ear hanging was shown longer when W was stroked as compared to NV (P < 0.001), but neck stretching was observed longer during stroking NV as compared to W only after the treatment period (P < 0.01). In the first test session, more animals showed head shaking and head throwing during stroking W and NV than LC (P < 0.01), whereas in the second test session these behaviours were observed only in few animals. In the first test session heart rate was higher during stroking W than the other body regions (P ≤ 0.01). In the second test session, the lowest heart rate was found during stroking NV (P < 0.05). Finally, contact with the experimenter following stroking differed for the three body regions stroked in both test sessions (first: P = 0.06, second: P < 0.01); contact was shortest for LC. When comparing both test sessions, stretching the neck and ear hanging increased (P < 0.001), while head shaking and head throwing decreased (P < 0.05); there was no difference for heart rate and contact with the experimenter. The four treatments had no influence on reactions to stroking. To conclude, stroking of body regions often licked during social grooming led to more responses than stroking the one licked rarely. Some reactions, such as stretching the neck, are also observed during social licking. This suggests that cows may in part perceive human stroking of body regions often licked similarly to social licking. This knowledge could be of interest for an improvement in quality of human–cattle interactions.',\n",

The parametric bootstrap is used to approximate this distribution. In order to investigate the presence of multiple (global) modes the congruence between the results of information-based methods based on asymptotic theory and those derived using the models fitted to the bootstrap samples with initalization in the solution as well as random initialization is assessed.

We have previously identified two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the IL-10 receptor 1 (IL-10R1) causing a substitution of glycine 330 to arginine (G330R) and of serine 138 to glycine (S138G). A possible association between these IL-10R1 variants and schizophrenia has been investigated in the present study. DNA of 101 unrelated Austrian patients with a DSM-III-R (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) consensus diagnosis of schizophrenia (n\\u2009=\\u200970) or schizoaffective disorder (n\\u2009=\\u200931) and DNA of 121 German schizophrenic patients (DSM-III-R) was analyzed for the presence of S138G and G330R by allele-specific multiplex PCRs. Data from patients were compared with 250 unrelated, psychiatric healthy controls. No difference in allele frequency was detected between patients and controls (G330R: 34.0% vs. 30.0%, P\\u2009=\\u20090.208; S138G: 19.7% vs. 16.6%, P\\u2009=\\u20090.235; by Fisher's exact test).

       "  {'abstract': 'Individual mouse strains differ significantly in terms of behaviour, cognitive function and long-term potentiation. Hippocampal gene expression profiling of eight different mouse strains points towards strain-specific regulation of genes involved in neuronal information storage. Protein expression with regard to strain- dependent expression of structures related to neuronal information storage has not been investigated yet. Herein, a proteomic approach based on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF) has been chosen to address this question by determining strain-dependent expression of proteins involved in neurotransmission and activity-induced actin remodelling in hippocampal tissue of five mouse strains. Of 31 spots representing 16 different gene products analysed and quantified, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein-α, actin-like protein 3, profilin and cofilin were expressed in a strain-dependent manner. By treating protein expression as a phenotype, we have shown significant genetic variation in brain protein expression. Further experiments in this direction may provide an indication of the genetic elements that contribute to the phenotypic differences between the selected strains through the expressional level of the translated protein. In view of this, we propose that proteomic analysis enabling to concomitantly survey the expression of a large number of proteins could serve as a valuable tool for genetic and physiological studies of central nervous system function.',\n",

To test subsamples of affectively disordered patients, we examined age of onset (AoO), numbers of episodes and melancholic type of clinical manifestation. Using PCR and RFLP, we investigated in patients with unipolar depression and bipolar disorder (BP) whether the CLOCK T3111C SNP is associated with affective disorders (n=102) compared to healthy controls (n=103). No differences were found either in genotype or allele frequency distributions of T3111C polymorphism between patients compared to healthy controls (p>0.2).

       "  {'abstract': 'Software development has become an important part of management science, although often only “behind the scenes”. More and more papers present results that are based on complicated simulations or numerical techniques and the percentage of research related to computations is continuously increasing. Although many researchers would never call themselves “software developers” they spend considerable amounts of time programming simulation studies or writing a prototype implementation of a new al- gorithm to be able to benchmark it against the state-of-the-art. Reproducibility of results and incremental development by reuse of available knowledge have been two of the main principles of science throughout the centuries. If we want to make the computational aspects of management science adhere to these principles, open source software can help a lot. To reproduce tables and figures which are the result of complicated computations, a superficial description of how the results were obtained is in many cases not sufficient to reproduce them. In fact, often only the code used to obtain the results will allow others to verify them. Proposing a new data analytic technique in a paper without providing a reference implementation of the algorithm means that everybody who wants to try the method has to reinvent the wheel by reimplementation. Providing code as proprietary software is much better than nothing, but hinders incremental improvements because it is hard to try modifications of existing techniques. The success of open source software projects like the Linux operating system or the R environment for statistical computing are based on the fact that anybody can and may improve the existing code. Obviously closed source code cannot be part of the scientific output if computations shall be reviewed by the scientific community, hence convenient tools for distributing scientific open source software are needed. R provides both a comprehensive environment for data analysis as well as the mechanism to easily share methodology via its packaging system.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'The assessment of the performance of learners by means of benchmark experiments is an established exercise. In practice, benchmark studies are a tool to compare the performance of several competing algorithms for a certain learning problem. Cross-validation or resampling techniques are commonly used to derive point estimates of the performances which are compared to identify algorithms with good properties. For several benchmarking problems, test procedures taking the variability of those point estimates into account have been suggested. Most of the recently proposed inference procedures are based on special variance estimators for the cross-validated performance. We introduce a theoretical framework for inference problems in benchmark experiments and show that standard statistical test procedures can be used to test for differences in the performances. The theory is based on well-defined distributions of performance measures which can be compared with established tests. To demonstrate the usefulness in practice, the theoretical results are applied to regression and classification benchmark studies based on artificial and real world data.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'Inbred mouse strains have different genetic backgrounds that can result in impairment of synaptic plasticity and memory. Strain-dependent performance in behavioral and cognitive tasks is well-documented. Hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), an activity-dependent enhancement of synaptic transmission that may underlie some forms of learning and memory has been shown to differ significantly between inbred mouse strains. However, an effect of strain on the expression of proteins, critically involved in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory has not been described yet. We have been addressing this question by determining expressional levels of a panel of proteins involved in neuronal information processing in hippocampus of five mouse strains by immunoblotting. Four inbred strains (FVB/N, C57Bl/6J, 129S2/Sv and Balb/c), commonly used for generating genetically modified mice and for conventional experiments in pharmacology and toxicology and one outbred strain (OF1) have been selected. A significant effect of strain was detected for total and phosphorylated calcium-calmodulin dependent kinase IIalpha (CaMKII, pCaMKII), phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase (pMAPK), total and phosphorylated calcium-responsive element binding 1 (creb, pcreb), early-growth response protein 1 (egr 1), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), drebrin and postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95). These results may indicate genetic determination of synaptic plasticity-related mechanisms relevant for the molecular events mediating hippocampal information processing and storage. Data presented herein highlight the importance of careful selection of the mouse strain for studies of synaptic plasticity.',\n",

Method: Eighty-one patients with bulimia nervosa were randomly assigned to either a self-help manual with a maximum of 18 short weekly visits (guided self-help) or to 18 weekly 1.5-h sessions of cognitive-behavioral group therapy (CBT). The primary outcome variables were monthly frequencies of self-reported binge eating and vomiting episodes. Secondary outcome variables were eating disorder-related psychopathology (assessed with the Eating Disorders Inventory [EDI]) and depression (assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory [BDI]). Patients were followed up 1 year after the end of treatment. Results: A mixed-effects linear regression analysis indicated that subjects in both treatment conditions showed a significant decrease over time in binge eating and vomiting frequencies, in the scores of the EDI subscales, and in the BDI. Both treatment modalities led to a sustained improvement at follow-up. A separate analysis of the completer sample showed significantly higher remission rates in the self-help condition (74%) compared with the CBT condition (44%) at follow-up. Conclusions: Guided self-help incorporating the use of a self-help manual offers an approach that can be effective in the short and long-term treatment of bulimia nervosa.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': \"Serotonergic mechanisms are thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of seasonal affective disorder (SAD). The expression of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) is regulated in part by an insertion/deletion polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene promoter region (5-HTTLPR). The 5-HTTLPR short allele (s) has been associated with anxiety-related personality traits and depression, and one study observed an association between the 5-HTTLPR s-allele and SAD and the trait of seasonality. We genotyped 138 SAD patients and 146 healthy volunteers with low seasonality for 5-HTTLPR. No difference between patients and controls was found for genotype distribution and s-allele frequency. However, genotype distribution and allele frequencies were strongly associated with DSM-IV depression subtypes. Melancholic depression was associated with the 5-HTTLPR long (l) allele and atypical depression with the 5-HTTLPR s-allele (two-sided Fisher's exact test: genotype distribution: P=0.0038; allele frequencies: P=0.007). Our data are compatible with the hypothesis of a disease process that is not causally related to 5-HTTLPR, but involves 5-HT neurotransmission and 5-HTTLPR somewhere on its way to phenotypic disease expression.\",\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'Background: Despite the widely accepted view that schizophrenia and bipolar disorder represent independent illnesses and modes of inheritance, some data in the literature suggest that the diseases may share some genetic susceptibility. The objective of our analyses was to search for vulnerability loci for the two disorders. Methods: A genomewide map of 388 microsatellite DNA markers was genotyped in five schizophrenia and three bipolar disorder Austrian families. Linkage analyses was used to compute the usual parametric logarithm of the likelihood of linkage (LOD) scores and nonparametric linkage analysis (NPL scores Z(all)) was used to assess the pattern of allele sharing at each marker locus relative to the presence of the disease (GENEHUNTER). Affected status was defined as severe affective disorder or schizophrenia. Results: Across the genome, p values associated with NPL scores resulted in evidence (i.e., p <.0007) for linkage at marker D3S1265 on chromosome 3q (NPL score Z (all) = 3.74, p =.0003). Two other markers (on 3q and 6q) showed p values of <.01. Conclusions: We detected a potential susceptibility locus for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia on chromosome 3q, which has not been reported previously. The possibility of a false positive result has to be taken into account. Our data suggest shared loci for schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorders and are consistent with the continuum model of psychosis.',\n",

Methods: Over a period of 12 months (June 1994 to May 1995) we recruited patients consecutively admitted to our psychiatric university outpatient clinic in a prospective study. All patients were diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, revised 4th edition. A total of 344 patients presented themselves with a diagnosis of affective disorder. Out of these, 36 were diagnosed as having SAD. From the same group of 344 patients, we selected a matched control group of 36 patients suffering from NSMD. The experimental and control groups were matched according to sex, age, severity of illness and number of siblings. Results: There was no significant difference concerning the lifetime prevalences for psychiatric disorders among the fist-degree relatives in both groups (SAD = 16.5% and NSMD = 19%). Conclusion: It seems that there is no difference in familiarity for psychiatric disorders between SAD and NSMD.',\n",

Evidence from various studies has clearly demonstrated that genetic factors contribute substantially to the etiology. The goal of this study was to identify chromosomal regions likely to contain schizophrenia susceptibility genes. Methods: A genome-wide map of 388 microsatellite DNA markers was genotyped in 5 schizophrenia families. Nonparametric linkage analysis (Genehunter) was used to assess the pattern of allele sharing at each marker locus relative to the presence of disease. Results: Nonparametric linkage scores did not reach a genome-wide level of statistical significance (p < 0.00002) or a p value suggestive of linkage (p < 0.007) for any marker; however, one p value suggested replicated linkage (p < 0.01) at chromosome 6p24 in region D6S309 (p = 0.0047). Furthermore, 11 markers resulted in p < 0.05 at chromosomes 6p, 6q, 10q, 12q and 14q. Conclusions: Despite the differences in diagnostic schemes, in markers used and methods of analyses between studies published so far, we think that our result supports the notion that there is possibly some consistent evidence for replicated linkage of a schizophrenia susceptibility locus around the region of D6S309 at chromosome 6p24.',\n",

Therefore, we studied candidate genes in a sample of unrelated patients (n = 102) and healthy controls (n = 79) of Austrian origin, searching for a possible association between polymorphic DNA markers of 5 candidate genes (serotonin transporter, 5-HTT; serotonin 2a receptor, 5-HT2a; dopamine D2 receptor, DRD2; dopamine D3 receptor, DRD3; dopamine transporter, DAT1) and bipolar disorder. There was an association between allelic and genotypic frequencies of 5-HTT and affection status (p = 0.014 and p = 0.017, respectively). However, after correction for multiple comparisons (Bonferroni), these results did not remain significant.

If at least one characteristic root lies inside the unit circle, then the process is transient. AR-NN processes with characteristic roots lying on the unit circle exhibit either ergodic, random walk, or transient behavior. We also analyze the class of integrated AR-NN (ARI-NN) processes and show that a standardized ARI-NN process “converges” to a Wiener process.

       "  {'abstract': 'Evaluating new methods and algorithms in unsupervised learning obviously requires thorough benchmarking studies on data sets that most closely reflect performance in actual usage. Designing data sets that do exactly that is quite a challenging task in itself; standing up to the challenge in comparison to other methods is another point which poses a risk of compromising the goal of an objective benchmarking study. We want to address the latter by proposing a framework that standardizes the format of artificial data, or rather its metadata. We intend to introduce a web repository that functions as an exchange for metadata of artificial data and an accompanying R package that can generate actual data from the descriptions obtained from the repository. It is therefore much simpler to find data designed by others and which has been used in previous benchmarking studies. This removes some of the temptation to specifically design artificial data in a way so that a proposed method performs significantly better than existing ones, a claim that might not hold in real life applications.',\n",

However, for an accurate comparison of age-related lipid alterations, it is necessary to analyse the lens present from birth, i.e. the nucleus. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to analyse lipid changes to individual human lens nuclear regions with age, and map the lens lipid distribution using highly sensitive analytical tools.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': \"We introduce a generic simulation framework suitable for agent-based simulations featuring the support of heterogeneous agents, hierarchical scheduling, and flexible specification of design parameters. One key aspect of this framework is the design specification: we use a format based on the Extendible Markup Language (XML) that is simple-structured yet still enables the design of flexible models. Another issue in agent-based simulations, especially when ready-made components are used, is the heterogeneity arising from both the agents' implementations and the underlying platforms. To tackle such obstacles, we introduce a wrapper technique for mapping the functionality of agents living in an interpreter-based environment to a standardized JAVA interface, thus facilitating the task for any control mechanism (like a simulation manager) because it has to handle only one set of commands for all agents involved. Again, this mapping is made by an XML-based definition format. We demonstrate the technique by applying it to a simple sample simulation of two mass marketing firms operating in an artificial consumer environment.\",\n",

High scores for NS seemed to be associated with long alleles of a DRD4 polymorphism. Furthermore, an association between personality traits and the dopamine 2 (DRD2) receptor gene was reported. NS and persistence (PS) high scores seemed to be associated with alleles of DRD2. We examined 109 (78 female and 31 male) normal healthy individuals using Cloninger's Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) in order to replicate these findings. We genotyped a 48 base pair variable number of tandem repeats (from two to eight repeats) polymorphism in the third exon of DRD4 and a Cys311Ser polymorphism in exon 7 of DRD2. We tested alleles and genotypes of DRD4 (allele 7 absent or present; genotype 4,4 versus 4,7), and Ser/Cys and Cys/Cys genotypes of DRD2 for associations with TCI values. NS and the alleles and genotypes of DRD4 did not show any association. In associating the genotypes of DRD2 with TCI scales (NS, harm avoidance, reward dependence and PS), we also found no association. Recent findings associating NS with DRD4 could not be replicated. With regard to DRD2, we tested a different polymorphism as published recently and could not find an association of TCI scales with the gene. The present results therefore do not provide evidence that the DRD2 and DRD4 receptor genes contribute a common and relevant effect to personality traits.\",\n",

In a pot experiment, we studied both short-term and long-term effects on deep burrowing earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris) and soil functions. Therefore, the cover crop Sinapis alba was grown in soils with either 3.0% or 4.1% soil organic matter content (SOM) and either sprayed with a GBH (Touchdown Quattro, Roundup PowerFlex, or Roundup LB Plus) or the respective glyphosate AI (diammonium-, potassium-, or isopropylamine-salt) or hand weeded (control). Long-term effects showed increased earthworm activity under GBHs even 4 months after application, but similar activity under AIs and control. Another application of the same treatments 5 months after the previous one also increased earthworm activity under GBHs, especially at high SOM levels. Water infiltration after a simulated heavy rainfall was 50% lower, and leaching was 30% higher under GBH than under AI application or hand weeding. Individual GBHs and AIs varied in their effects and were influenced by SOM and soil moisture. Full disclosure of all ingredients in GBH formulations would be necessary to allow a comprehensive assessment of environmental risks.</jats:p>', 'authors': ['Verena Brandmaier', 'Anna Altmanninger', 'Friedrich Leisch', 'Edith Gruber', 'Eszter Takács', 'Mária Mörtl', 'Szandra Klátyik', 'András Székács', 'Johann G.

       "('<jats:p>Glyphosate is the most widely used active ingredient (AI) in thousands of glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) worldwide. Short-term impacts of AIs or GBHs on earthworms are well known, but few studies have examined long-term legacy effects &gt;3 months after application. In a pot experiment, we studied both short-term and long-term effects on deep burrowing earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris) and soil functions. Therefore, the cover crop Sinapis alba was grown in soils with either 3.0% or 4.1% soil organic matter content (SOM) and either sprayed with a GBH (Touchdown Quattro, Roundup PowerFlex, or Roundup LB Plus) or the respective glyphosate AI (diammonium-, potassium-, or isopropylamine-salt) or hand weeded (control). Long-term effects showed increased earthworm activity under GBHs even 4 months after application, but similar activity under AIs and control. Another application of the same treatments 5 months after the previous one also increased earthworm activity under GBHs, especially at high SOM levels. Water infiltration after a simulated heavy rainfall was 50% lower, and leaching was 30% higher under GBH than under AI application or hand weeding. Individual GBHs and AIs varied in their effects and were influenced by SOM and soil moisture. Full disclosure of all ingredients in GBH formulations would be necessary to allow a comprehensive assessment of environmental risks.</jats:p>',\n",

The number of reports published on a posteriori market segmentation studies has rapidly increased since Haley’s milestone publication on benefit segmentation in 1968. Nevertheless, it is common practice to use a single segmentation base only and to run a single calculation of a single algorithm, which dramatically increases the chance of building an entire marketing plan on a random solution of the algorithm chosen. The application presented constructs winter vacation styles based on guest survey data, avoiding both weaknesses mentioned before. Through the replicative framework provided by bagged clustering, potentially suboptimal random solutions are avoided. Independent partitioning of vacation activities and travel motives leads to more holistic segments. By looking for over and underrepresentation of all combinations of the behavioral and psychographic segmentation, vacation styles are identified and studied in detail.</jats:p>', 'DOI': '10.1177/0047287502239037', 'type': 'journal-article', 'created': {'date-parts': [[2003, 7, 19]], 'date-time': '2003-07-19T05:53:44Z', 'timestamp': 1058594024000}, 'page': '281-292', 'source': 'Crossref', 'is-referenced-by-count': 94, 'title': ['Winter Tourist Segments in Austria: Identifying Stable Vacation Styles Using Bagged Clustering Techniques'], 'prefix': '10.1177', 'volume': '41', 'author': [{'given': 'Sara', 'family': 'Dolnicar', 'sequence': 'first', 'affiliation': []}, {'given': 'Friedrich', 'family': 'Leisch', 'sequence': 'additional', 'affiliation': []}], 'member': '179', 'published-online': {'date-parts': [[2016, 8, 18]]}, 'reference': [{'key': 'atypb1', 'unstructured': 'Ahmed, S.

Short-term impacts of AIs or GBHs on earthworms are well known, but few studies have examined long-term legacy effects >3 months after application. In a pot experiment, we studied both short-term and long-term effects on deep burrowing earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris) and soil functions. Therefore, the cover crop Sinapis alba was grown in soils with either 3.0% or 4.1% soil organic matter content (SOM) and either sprayed with a GBH (Touchdown Quattro, Roundup PowerFlex, or Roundup LB Plus) or the respective glyphosate AI (diammonium-, potassium-, or isopropylamine-salt) or hand weeded (control). Long-term effects showed increased earthworm activity under GBHs even 4 months after application, but similar activity under AIs and control. Another application of the same treatments 5 months after the previous one also increased earthworm activity under GBHs, especially at high SOM levels. Water infiltration after a simulated heavy rainfall was 50% lower, and leaching was 30% higher under GBH than under AI application or hand weeding. Individual GBHs and AIs varied in their effects and were influenced by SOM and soil moisture. Full disclosure of all ingredients in GBH formulations would be necessary to allow a comprehensive assessment of environmental risks.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'The value of travel time savings (VTTS) representing the willingness to pay to reduce travel time, consists of two components: the value of liberating time [equal to the value of leisure (VoL)] and the value of time assigned to travel (VTAT), representing the travel conditions of a trip. Their relative values indicate which dimension to emphasize when investing in transport: speed or comfort. In this paper, we formulate and estimate a framework aimed at the improvement in the estimation of the VoL. By introducing a novel treatment of time assigned to domestic work, we consider that unpaid labor should be assigned a wage rate as a measure of the expenses avoided when assigning time to those chores. We use state-of-the-art data on time use and expenses as well as online data on gig workers collected in Austria, and apply the time-use and expenditure model of Jara-Diaz et al. (Transp Res Part B 42(10):946–957, 2008). The wage rates for paid and unpaid work were combined to re-formulate the budget constraint, which affected women more than men due to the higher involvement of the former in domestic activities. Compared against the original estimation, the VoL changed from €10/h for men and €6/h for women to €9/h for both genders, which in turn yields a larger average VTAT, which becomes positive for public transport. As a conclusion, the novel treatment of domestic labor contributes to closing the gap in the VoL between genders and highlights the power of unveiling the components behind the VTTS. The empirical findings imply that investments in travel time reductions rather than in comfort should be prioritized, given the very good conditions of public transport in Austria.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': ' The production of synthetic pesticides is energy intensive and can emit even more greenhouse gases (GHG) per kg than the production of synthetic fertilizers. However, this aspect is largely neglected when it comes to agriculture’s contribution to GHG emissions. Using official pesticide sales data from Austria from 2000 to 2019, we analyzed (i) trends in insecticide, fungicide, and herbicide use and calculated production-related GHG emissions, and (ii) the share of pesticide-related versus fertilizer-related GHG emissions in three agricultural crops with different pesticide intensities: sugar beets, apples, and grapevines. We found that between 2000 and 2019, insecticide amounts increased by 58%, fungicide amounts increased by 29%, and herbicide amounts decreased by 29%; associated GHG emissions showed similar patterns. During the same period, acreage under conventional arable crops, orchards, and vineyards decreased by an average of 19%, indicating an increase in management intensity. In intensive apple production, GHG emissions associated with pesticide production and application accounted for 51% of total GHG emissions, in viticulture 37%, and in sugar beets 12%. We have shown that GHG emissions due to pesticide production and application can be significant, especially for pesticide-intensive crops. We therefore recommend that these pesticide-derived GHG emissions should also be attributed to the agricultural sector.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'Background Pesticide use has been associated with risks for human health and an overall decline in biodiversity. Although herbicides are the most commonly used pesticides worldwide, they have received less attention in this debate. We investigated the extent to which long-term trends in herbicide use in Austria influence potential toxic exposures to non-target organisms and potential risks to humans. We analyzed official sales data of 101 herbicide active ingredients (AIs) approved in Austria between 2010 and 2019 regarding their ecotoxicological properties based on lethal doses (LD50 and LC50) weighed by their persistence in the environment (DT50) for honeybees (Apis mellifera), earthworms (Eisenia fetida), and birds (Serinus serinus). Human health risks were qualitatively assessed based on official hazard statements for the AIs used. Results In Austria, herbicide amounts sold decreased significantly by 24% from 1480 to 1123 tonnes between 2010 and 2019. This also led to a considerable decrease in the amounts of AIs classified by H-statements of the EU Pesticides Database: − 71% acute inhalation toxicity, − 58% reproductive toxicity,− 47% specific target organ toxicity. Yet, 36% of herbicides used were still classified as highly hazardous pesticides according to the Pesticide Action Network. Surprisingly, over the same period, toxic loads to honeybees increased by 487% (oral exposure), while lethal toxic loads to earthworms increased by 498%, and to birds by 580%. This can be attributed to a shift toward the use of more acutely toxic and especially more persistent AIs. The most problematic AI for honeybees, earthworms, birds and humans was the highly persistent diquat. The further ranking of the most toxic herbicides varied considerably depending on the organism. It is important to note that this toxic load assessment, like official environmental risk assessments, evaluates the potential risk but not the actual fatalities or real-world exposure. Conclusions Our results show a trade-off between herbicide amounts and toxicological hazards to humans and other non-target organisms. These interdependencies need to be considered when implementing pesticide reduction targets to protect public health and biodiversity, such as the EU´s “farm-to-fork” strategy, which aims to reduce the amounts and risks of synthetic pesticides.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'The invasive Spanish slug (Arion vulgaris) is an important pest species in agriculture and horticulture in Europe. In the last decades it has spread across the continent where it outcompetes native slug and snail species, thus posing a threat for biodiversity. A popular anecdote suggests to promote Roman snails (Helix pomatia) in gardens because they are able to control A. vulgaris. We examined a potential interrelationship between these two species using a mesocosm experiment with lettuce plants. 13C-15N stable isotope labelling of lettuce allowed us to investigate interactions between Helix and Arion on weight gain/loss and herbivory. Additionally, we wanted to know whether different watering regimes (daily vs. every 3rd day watering of weekly amount) and earthworms alter these interactions. Egg predation of Helix on Arion eggs was further tested in a food-choice experiment. Arion showed a five times higher herbivory per body mass than Helix in a single-species setting. However, in mesocosms containing both species percentage of herbivory per body mass was significantly lower than in Arion-only mesocosms, especially when watered every three days. Overall isotope uptake via eaten lettuce was unaffected by the presence of the other species. Only very little predation (three out of 200 eggs) of Helix on Arion eggs was observed. Our results provide no evidence for a clear dismissal or confirmation of the popular gardener’s anecdote that Helix snails have a negative effect on Arion abundance or herbivory.',\n",

Knowledge of spatial and temporal patterns of deer-vehicle accidents is inevitable for accident analysis and mitigation efforts with temporal deer-vehicle accident data being much more difficult to obtain in sufficient data quality. We described the temporal patterns of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) roadkills occurring in the period 2002–2006 in southeastern Austria. Using a comprehensive dataset, consisting of 11.771 data points, we examined the influence of different time units (i.e. season, month, day of week, day of year), illumination categories (coarse and fine temporal resolution) and lunar phases on deer-vehicle accidents by performing linear and generalized additive models. Thereby, we identified peak accident periods within the analyzed time units. Highest frequencies of deer-vehicle accidents occurred in November, May and October, on Fridays, and during nights. Relationships between lunar phases and roe deer-vehicle accidents were analysed, providing evidence for high frequencies of deer-vehicle accidents during full moon phases. We suggest that deer-vehicle accidents are dependent both on human activity in traffic and wildlife activity, which is in turn affected by phenology, intra- and interspecific competition, climatic and astronomical events. Our results highlight, that short-term mitigation measures (e.g. traffic controls and speed limits) can be highly effective to reduce deer-vehicle accidents, but should be flexibly adapted to specific temporal periods.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'Background Glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) are among the most often used pesticides. The hundreds of GBHs used worldwide consist of the active ingredient (AI) glyphosate in form of different salts, possibly other AIs, and various mostly undisclosed co-formulants. Pesticide risk assessments are commonly performed using single AIs or GBHs at standard soil conditions without vegetation. In a greenhouse experiment, we established a weed population with common amaranth (Amaranthus retroflexus) to examine the effects of three GBHs (Roundup LB Plus, Roundup PowerFlex, Touchdown Quattro) and their corresponding AIs (salts of glyphosate isopropylammonium, potassium, diammonium) on the activity and physiological biomarkers (glutathione S-transferase, GST; acetylcholine esterase, AChE) of an ecologically relevant earthworm species (Lumbricus terrestris). GBHs and AIs were applied at recommended doses; hand weeding served as control. Experiments were established with two soil types differing in organic matter content (SOM; 3.0% vs. 4.1%) and other properties. Results Earthworm activity (casting and movement activity) decreased after application of glyphosate formulations or active ingredients compared to hand weeding. We found no consistent pattern that formulations had either higher or lower effects on earthworm activity than their active ingredients; rather, differences were substance-specific. Earthworm activity was little affected by soil organic matter levels. Biomarkers remained unaffected by weed control types; GST but not AChE was decreased under high SOM. Water infiltration after a simulated heavy rainfall was interactively affected by weed control types and SOM. Leachate amount was higher after application of formulations than active ingredients and was higher under low SOM. Glyphosate concentrations in soil and leachate were strongly affected by application of formulations or active ingredients and varied with SOM (significant weed control type x SOM interaction). Conclusions We found that both commercial formulations and pure active ingredients can influence earthworms with consequences on important soil functions. Glyphosate products showed increased, reduced or similar effects than pure glyphosate on particular soil functions; soil properties can substantially alter this. Especially at lower SOM, heavy rainfalls could lead to more glyphosate leaching into water bodies. A full disclosure of co-formulants would be necessary to further decipher their specific contributions to these inconsistent effects.',\n",

The study presented in this paper demonstrates how the accuracy of certain indices can be significantly improved when calculated numerous times on data sets resampled from the original data. There are obviously many ways to resample data—in this study, three very common options are used: bootstrapping, data splitting (without subset overlap of two subsamples), and random subsetting (with subset overlap of two subsamples). Index values calculated on the basis of resampled data sets are compared to the values obtained from the original data partition. The primary hypothesis of the study states that resampling does generally improve index accuracy. The hypothesis is based on the notion of cluster stability: if there are stable clusters in a data set, a clustering algorithm should produce consistent results for data sampled or resampled from the same source. The primary hypothesis was partly confirmed; for external validation measures, it does indeed apply. The secondary hypothesis states that the resampling strategy itself does not play a significant role. This was also shown to be accurate, yet slight deviations between the resampling schemes suggest that splitting appears to yield slightly better results.',\n",

However, current wound infection models mostly use single-strain bacteria. To mimic clinically occurring infections caused by fecal contamination in immunocompromised/immobile patients, which differ significantly from single-strain infections, the present study aimed at the establishment of a new mouse model using infection by fecal bacteria. Dorsal circular excision wounds in immunosuppressed mice were infected with fecal slurry solution in several dilutions up to 1:8,000. Impact of immunosuppressor, bacterial load and timing on development of wound infections was investigated. Wounds were analyzed by scoring, 3D imaging and swab analyses. Autofluorescence imaging was not successful. Dose-finding of cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppression was necessary for establishment of bacterial wound infections. Infection with fecal slurry diluted 1:166 to 1:400 induced significantly delayed wound healing (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05) without systemic reactions. Swab analyses post-infection matched the initial polymicrobial suspension. The customized wound score confirmed significant differences between the groups (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05).

Moreover, it is largely unknown to what extent different soil characteristics alter potential side effects of herbicides. We conducted a greenhouse experiment growing a model weed population of Amaranthus retroflexus in arable field soil with either 3.0 or 4.1% soil organic matter (SOM) content and treated these weeds either with GBHs (Roundup LB Plus, Touchdown Quattro, Roundup PowerFlex) or their respective AIs (isopropylammonium, diammonium or potassium salts of glyphosate) at recommended dosages. Control pots were mechanically weeded. Nontarget effects were assessed on the surface activity of the springtail species Sminthurinus niger (pitfall trapping) and litter decomposition in the soil (teabag approach). Both GBHs and AIs increased the surface activity of springtails compared to control pots; springtail activity was higher under GBHs than under corresponding AIs. Stimulation of springtail activity was much higher in soil with higher SOM content than with low SOM content (significant treatment x SOM interaction). Litter decomposition was unaffected by GBHs, AIs or SOM levels.

Models to predict quantity, host cell proteins (HCP), and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) content simultaneously were developed and exemplified by a cation exchange capture step for fibroblast growth factor 2 expressed in Escherichia coliOnline data and corresponding offline data for product quantity and co-eluting impurities, such as dsDNA and HCP, were analyzed using boosted structured additive regression. Different sensor combinations were used to achieve the best prediction performance for each quality attribute. Quantity can be adequately predicted by applying a small predictor set of the typical chromatographic workstation sensor signals with a test error of 0.85 mg/ml (range in training data: 0.1–28 mg/ml). For HCP and dsDNA additional fluorescence and/or attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared spectral information was important to achieve prediction errors of 200 (2–6579 ppm) and 340 ppm (8–3773 ppm), respectively.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'Clustering functional data is mostly based on the projection of the curves onto an adequate basis and building random effects models of the basis coefficients. The parameters can be fitted with an EM algorithm. Alternatively, distance models based on the coefficients are used in the literature. Similar to the case of clustering multidimensional data, a variety of derivations of different models has been published. Although their calculation procedure is similar, their implementations are very different including distinct hyperparameters and data formats as input. This makes it difficult for the user to apply and particularly to compare them. Furthermore, they are mostly limited to specific basis functions. This paper aims to show the common elements between existing models in highly cited articles, first on a theoretical basis. Later their implementation is analyzed and it is illustrated how they could be improved and extended to a more general level. A special consideration is given to those models designed for sparse measurements. The work resulted in the R package funcy which was built to integrate the modified and extended algorithms into a unique framework.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are the number one production system for therapeutic proteins. A pre-requirement for their use in industrial production of biopharmaceuticals is to be clonal, thus originating from a single cell in order to be phenotypically and genomically identical. In the present study it was evaluated whether standard procedures, such as the generation of a recombinant cell line in combination with selection for a specific and stable phenotype (expression of the recombinant product) or subcloning have any impact on karyotype stability or homogeneity in CHO cells. Analyses used were the distribution of chromosome counts per cell as well as chromosome painting to identify specific karyotype patterns within a population. Results indicate that subclones both of the host and the recombinant cell line are of comparable heterogeneity and (in)stability as the original pool. In contrast, the rigorous selection for a stably expressing phenotype generated cell lines with fewer variation and more stable karyotypes, both at the level of the sorted pool and derivative subclones. We conclude that the process of subcloning itself does not contribute to an improved karyotypic homogeneity of a population, while the selection for a specific cell property inherently can provide evolutionary pressure that may lead to improved chromosomal stability as well as to a more homogenous population.',\n",

CHO-S, CHO-K1 8\\u2009mM glutamine, and CHO-K1 cells adapted to grow in media containing no glutamine were analyzed over up to 6 months in culture.

Chromosome Painting revealed a predominant karyotype for each cell line at the start of the experiment, completed by a large number of variants present in each population. Over time in culture, the predominant karyotype changed for CHO-S and CHO-K1, with the diversity increasing and new variants appearing, while CHO-K1 0\\u2009mM Gln preferred chromosome pattern increased in percent of the population over time.

       "  {'abstract': 'Ideation, or the formulation of ideas pertaining to a particular topic, is the precursor to individuals making significant life decisions. Many individuals think about foster caring long before they actually become carers, and it stands to reason that in many cases, carer discontinuation also follows a period of ideation. This being the case, it is possible that by monitoring ideation, interventions could be introduced to prevent placement disruptions occurring, particularly if the sources of dissatisfaction are known. Using a sample of 205 foster carers, a posteriori segmentation analysis identifies groups of carers dissatisfied with the same aspects of their role. One group is particularly dissatisfied with factors that are within the control of foster care agencies and also reports high levels of discontinuation ideation. Recommendations include that the individual support needs of carers be identified such that customized support can be offered, including boosting initial and ongoing training to manage expectations and ensure carers feel prepared for the role. Results also highlight the important role of caseworkers in making carers feel appreciated and taken seriously.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'We propose a general framework for regression models with functional response containing a potentially large number of flexible effects of functional and scalar covariates. Special emphasis is put on historical functional effects, where functional response and functional covariate are observed over the same interval and the response is only influenced by covariate values up to the current grid point. Historical functional effects are mostly used when functional response and covariate are observed on a common time interval, as they account for chronology. Our formulation allows for flexible integration limits including, e.g., lead or lag times. The functional responses can be observed on irregular curve-specific grids. Additionally, we introduce different parameterizations for historical effects and discuss identifiability issues.The models are estimated by a component-wise gradient boosting algorithm which is suitable for models with a potentially high number of covariate effects, even more than observations, and inherently does model selection. By minimizing corresponding loss functions, different features of the conditional response distribution can be modeled, including generalized and quantile regression models as special cases. The methods are implemented in the open-source R package FDboost. The methodological developments are motivated by biotechnological data on Escherichia coli fermentations, but cover a much broader model class.',\n",

Most organisations are interested in finding one or a small number of target segments to focus on. Yet, traditional criteria used to select a segmentation solution assess the global quality of the segmentation solution. This approach comes at the risk of selecting a segmentation solution with good overall quality criteria which, however, does not contain groups of consumers representing particularly attractive target segments. The approach we propose helps managers to identify segmentation solutions containing attractive individual segments (e.g., more profitable), irrespective of the quality of the global segmentation solution.

       "  {'abstract': 'Background Several studies indicate associations between early growth and type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, it remains an open question whether these findings can be translated to typical growth patterns associated with increased risk for T1D-associated islet autoimmunity. Methods We analyzed pooled data from 2236 children followed up in two large prospective German birth cohorts with a genetically increased risk for T1D including 18\\u2009564 measurements of height and weight, which were transformed to sex- and age-specific standard deviation scores (SDS). A total of 191 children developed any islet autoantibodies, 101 multiple islet autoantibodies. We applied a model-based clustering technique to derive typical height and body mass index (BMI) growth patterns, stratified for maternal T1D status. These patterns were used to predict islet autoimmunity in logistic regression models, adjusted for potential confounders. Results Growth patterns were not associated with islet autoimmunity in the whole dataset and in children of diabetic mothers, respectively. In children of non-diabetic mothers ,however, islet autoimmunity was associated with rapidly increasing BMI SDS values until the age of 3\\u2009yr [adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 2.02 (1.03, 3.73) for development of any islet autoantibodies) and with consistently above average height SDS values [odds ratio: 2.21 (1.15, 4.17)]. In contrast, a pattern of high height SDS values at birth followed by a decrease to average values after 3\\u2009yr was associated with a reduced rate of islet autoimmunity [odds ratio: 0.16 (0.01, 0.62)].

       "  {'abstract': \" The quality of biopharmaceuticals and patients' safety are of highest priority and there are tremendous efforts to replace empirical production process designs by knowledge-based approaches. Main challenge in this context is that real-time access to process variables related to product quality and quantity is severely limited. To date comprehensive on- and offline monitoring platforms are used to generate process data sets that allow for development of mechanistic and/or data driven models for real-time prediction of these important quantities. Ultimate goal is to implement model based feed-back control loops that facilitate online control of product quality. In this contribution, we explore structured additive regression (STAR) models in combination with boosting as a variable selection tool for modeling the cell dry mass, product concentration, and optical density on the basis of online available process variables and two-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopic data. STAR models are powerful extensions of linear models allowing for inclusion of smooth effects or interactions between predictors. Boosting constructs the final model in a stepwise manner and provides a variable importance measure via predictor selection frequencies. Our results show that the cell dry mass can be modeled with a relative error of about ±3%, the optical density with ±6%, the soluble protein with ±16%, and the insoluble product with an accuracy of ±12%.

They manage this tension by finding justifications for their behaviour, rather than changing their behaviour. A recent study has systematized such justification; this systematics is used in the present study to investigate the existence of tourist segment sharing justification patterns. A finite mixture model with concomitant variables is used to analyse 2785 survey responses. Three segments are identified. The government blamers express strong interest in the environmental sustainability of their vacation, but deny both their responsibility and ability to make a difference. The struggling seekers would not book their dream vacation if it was environmentally unfriendly, yet do not feel in control of reducing negative environmental impacts of their holiday, which they fully acknowledge. The impact neglecters also state they would not book their dream vacation if it was environmentally unfriendly, but their main justification for taking – potentially environmentally harmful – vacations is denial of the negative environmental consequences of tourism. The existence of these differences in justification patterns indicates different approaches could counteract each of these segment-specific beliefs by inducing cognitive dissonance, shown in other contexts to induce behavioural change. Advice on approaches is given.',\n",

The evaluation of this programme is challenged through the voluntary participation and heterogeneous observation units. Therefore, we combine the Matching Method with the Difference-in-Difference estimation in order to overcome these problems and to estimate the impact of supported farm-investment activities on the economic performance of the Austrian farm holdings. In particular, we detect an increase in production, land renting and capital borrowing. Furthermore, a shift from the non-farm to farm activities, but with no statistically significant impact on the total income is shown.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'Product quality assurance strategies in production of biopharmaceuticals currently undergo a transformation from empirical “quality by testing” to rational, knowledge-based “quality by design” approaches. The major challenges in this context are the fragmentary understanding of bioprocesses and the severely limited real-time access to process variables related to product quality and quantity. Data driven modeling of process variables in combination with model predictive process control concepts represent a potential solution to these problems. The selection of statistical techniques best qualified for bioprocess data analysis and modeling is a key criterion. In this work a series of recombinant Escherichia coli fed-batch production processes with varying cultivation conditions employing a comprehensive on- and offline process monitoring platform was conducted. The applicability of two machine learning methods, random forest and neural networks, for the prediction of cell dry mass and recombinant protein based on online available process parameters and two-dimensional multi-wavelength fluorescence spectroscopy is investigated. Models solely based on routinely measured process variables give a satisfying prediction accuracy of about ± 4% for the cell dry mass, while additional spectroscopic information allows for an estimation of the protein concentration within ± 12%. The results clearly argue for a combined approach: neural networks as modeling technique and random forest as variable selection tool.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'An in-depth understanding of travel behaviour determinants, including the relationship to non-travel activities, is the foundation for modelling and policy making. National Travel Surveys (NTS) and time use surveys (TUS) are two major data sources for travel behaviour and activity participation. The aim of this paper is to systematically compare both survey types regarding travel activities and non-travel activities. The analyses are based on the German National Travel Survey and the German National Time Use Survey from 2002. The number of trips and daily travel time for mobile respondents were computed as the main travel estimates. The number of trips per person is higher in the German TUS when changes in location without a trip are included. Location changes without a trip are consecutive non-trip activities with different locations but without a trip in-between. The daily travel time is consistently higher in the German TUS. The main reason for this difference is the 10-min interval used. Differences in travel estimates between the German TUS and NTS result from several interaction effects. Activity time in NTS is comparable with TUS for subsistence activities. Our analyses confirm that both survey types have advantages and disadvantages. TUS provide reliable travel estimates. The number of trips even seems preferable to NTS if missed trips are properly identified and considered. Daily travel times are somewhat exaggerated due to the 10-min interval. The fixed time interval is the most important limitation of TUS data. The result is that trip times in TUS do not represent actual trip times very well and should be treated with caution. We can use NTS activity data for subsistence activities between the first trip and the last trip. This can potentially benefit activity-based approaches since most activities before the first trip and after the last trip are typical home-based activities which are rarely substituted by out-of-home activities.',\n",

Empirical results indicate that segments of tourists resistant to external or internal crisis events indeed exist and—as theoretically postulated—demonstrate higher levels of risk propensity and resistance to change. In contrast, risk shifting is not associated with being a crisis-resistant tourist.

       "  {'abstract': \"Accessibility in rural Austrian areas is more restricted than in urban regions. Limited accessibility leads to social exclusion. Therefore, mobility should be inclusive, allowing everyone to satisfy mobility needs and reach destinations. Mobility should also be environmentally friendly. Use of a private car offers opportunities for comprehensive mobility but is related with high individual, social, and environmental costs. We studied the interplay between employment, care, and mobility variables among people in the foothills of the European Alps in Lower Austria who are employed and have care responsibilities, assuming them to be a group with complex mobility needs and high vulnerability. The aim was to derive policy recommendations to decrease their car dependency and ensure accessibility. Adopting a mixed methods approach, we conducted a tailored quantitative and qualitative survey, using cluster analysis to derive relevant patterns. Within the group under analysis, 5 subgroups were identified: persons in 2 clusters worked more and cared less, with significant differences in commuting distances. Persons of 2 further clusters cared more and worked less, with one group caring for very young children, and the other working and caring a lot. Persons in the fifth cluster cared for elderly people, had low caring duties, and almost no pickup/drop-off trips; almost all had full-time jobs. Significant gender differences existed in the identified activity patterns. Results showed that responsibility for care is still mainly with women, even if they are increasingly seeking employment. Recommendations in 3 major fields of action were derived, comprising: measures to support the mobility of persons responsible for care, measures to support the autonomy of cared persons' mobility, and measures to reduce the mobility needs of both groups. Even if respondents are satisfied with how they manage their care tasks and employment by car, higher shares of walking, cycling, and public transport seem to be necessary and feasible.\",\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'Objectives: Cognitive behavioural guided self-help has been shown to be effective in mild and moderate depressive disorder. It is not known, however, if it is effective in individuals with partially remitted depressive disorder, which is a serious clinical problem in up to 50-60% of treated patients. This study is the first one to examine the clinical benefit of this intervention in this patient population. Design: For the purpose of this study, a single-blind, randomized controlled design was used. Method: We randomized 90 individuals with partially remitted depressive disorder either to cognitive behavioural guided self-help plus psychopharmacotherapy (n = 49) or psychopharmacotherapy alone (n = 41). They were clinically assessed at regular intervals with ratings of depressive symptoms and stress-coping strategies over a 3-week run-in period and a 6-week treatment period. Results: After 6 weeks, intention-to-treat analysis (n = 90) showed that patients treated with cognitive behavioural guided self-help plus psychopharmacotherapy did not have significantly lower scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale of Depression (17-item version; HRSD-17) and on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) compared to patients treated with psychopharmacotherapy alone. When negative stress-coping strategies were considered, there was a significant difference between the two groups at the end of treatment with respect to the BDI but not to the HRSD-17. Conclusions: Guided self-help did not lead to a significant reduction in symptom severity in patients with partially remitted depressive disorder after a 6-week intervention. However, the intervention leads to a reduction of negative stress-coping strategies. Practitioner points: Cognitive behavioural guided self-help did not significantly improve depressive symptoms measured with the Hamilton Rating Scale of Depression (17-item version; HRSD-17) in patients with partially remitted depressive disorder. Improvements were found in reducing negative stress-coping strategies for those allocated to the cognitive behavioural guided self-help, which significantly improved Beck Depression Inventory but not HRSD-17. These findings suggest that cognitive behavioural guided self-help may offer some assistance in managing negative stress-coping strategies.',\n",

In the present simulation study using artificial data of known structure, the impact of the difficulty of the segmentation task on the required sample size is analyzed in dependence of the number of variables in the segmentation base.

We propose to use order constrained solutions in K-means clustering to stabilize the results and improve the interpretability of the clustering. With this method a further improvement of the misclassification error in the aforementioned instrument recognition task is possible. Using order constrained K-means the musical structure of a whole piece of popular music can be extracted automatically. Visualizing the distances of the feature vectors through a self distance matrix allows for an easy visual verification of the result. For the estimation of the right number of clusters, we propose to calculate the adjusted Rand indices of bootstrap samples of the data and base the decision on the minimum of a robust version of the coefficient of variation. In addition to the average stability (measured through the adjusted Rand index) this approach takes the variation between the different bootstrap samples into account.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'The increasing number of deer–vehicle-accidents (DVAs) and the resulting economic costs have promoted numerous studies on behavioural and environmental factors which may contribute to the quantity, spatiotemporal distribution and characteristics of DVAs. Contrary to the spatial pattern of DVAs, data of their temporal pattern is scarce and difficult to obtain because of insufficient accuracy in available datasets, missing standardization in data aquisition, legal terms and low reporting rates to authorities. Literature of deer–traffic collisions on roads and railways is reviewed to examine current understanding of DVA temporal trends. Seasonal, diurnal and lunar peak accident periods are identified for deer, although seasonal pattern are not consistent among and within species or regions and data on effects of lunar cycles on DVAs is almost non-existent. Cluster analysis of seasonal DVA data shows nine distinct clusters of different seasonal DVA pattern for cervid species within the reviewed literature. Studies analyzing the relationship between time-related traffic predictors and DVAs yield mixed results. Despite the seasonal dissimilarity, diurnal DVA pattern are comparatively constant in deer, resulting in pronounced DVA peaks during the hours of dusk and dawn frequently described as bimodal crepuscular pattern. Behavioural aspects in activity seem to have the highest impact in DVAs temporal trends. Differences and variations are related to habitat-, climatic- and traffic characteristics as well as effects of predation, hunting and disturbance. Knowledge of detailed temporal DVA pattern is essential for prevention management as well as for the application and evaluation of mitigation measures.',\n",

The framework combines the advantages of benchmark experiments with the formal description of data set characteristics by means of statistical and information-theoretic measures and with the recursive partitioning of Bradley–Terry models for comparing the algorithms’ performances. The formal aspects of each component are introduced and illustrated by means of an artificial example.

There is general agreement that competition within the sector is increasing, and this has led to organizations placing greater emphasis on building strong brand images to differentiate themselves from competitors. However, there are also many instances where non-profits have successfully collaborated with each other to achieve efficiencies and meet objectives. The purpose of this exploratory study is to examine, which of these approaches – competition or collaboration – is more appropriate for the challenge of volunteer recruitment. We use data from an empirical study of 1415 Australians to investigate whether, based on perceived organizational brand images, volunteering organizations compete with each other for volunteers or are seen as complimentary. Results indicate that while consideration of organizations with certain brand images – especially the Heroes image – means that donation of time to other volunteering organizations is unlikely, other organizational brand images, such as that of being a local volunteering organization or one that provides support to people experiencing difficulty are likely to be compatible, opening up valuable opportunities for collaborative marketing for the purpose of volunteer recruitment.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'Data evaluation is a crucial step when it comes to the determination of accurate and precise isotope ratios computed from transient signals measured by multi-collector–inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICPMS) coupled to, for example, laser ablation (LA). In the present study, the applicability of different data evaluation strategies (i.e. ‘point-by-point’, ‘integration’ and ‘linear regression slope’ method) for the computation of 235U/238U isotope ratios measured in single particles by LA-MC-ICPMS was investigated. The analyzed uranium oxide particles (i.e. 9073-01-B, CRM U010 and NUSIMEP-7 test samples), having sizes down to the sub-micrometre range, are certified with respect to their 235U/238U isotopic signature, which enabled evaluation of the applied strategies with respect to precision and accuracy. The different strategies were also compared with respect to their expanded uncertainties. Even though the ‘point-by-point’ method proved to be superior, the other methods are advantageous, as they take weighted signal intensities into account. For the first time, the use of a ‘finite mixture model’ is presented for the determination of an unknown number of different U isotopic compositions of single particles present on the same planchet. The model uses an algorithm that determines the number of isotopic signatures by attributing individual data points to computed clusters. The 235U/238U isotope ratios are then determined by means of the slopes of linear regressions estimated for each cluster. The model was successfully applied for the accurate determination of different 235U/238U isotope ratios of particles deposited on the NUSIMEP-7 test samples.',\n",

More than a decade ago Josef Mazanec concluded that these formats may not the best choice, and that simple binary‐answer options are preferable in some empirical survey contexts. The purpose of the present study is to investigate empirically Mazanec's hypothesis in the context of the measurement of evaluative beliefs relating to fast‐food restaurants. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted an online experiment that asked respondents to assess evaluative beliefs relating to fast‐food brands using either a forced binary (n=100) or a seven‐point answer format (n=100). The authors also measured preferences for each of the fast‐food restaurants, user friendliness, and recorded the actual completion times for the survey. Findings The results indicate that the full binary answer format outperforms the popular seven‐point multi‐category format with respect to stability, concurrent validity, and speed of completion. Practical implications Given the demonstrated strengths of full binary measures, they should be used more by both practitioners and academics when measuring evaluative beliefs. Originality/value This study provides empirical evidence of the strong performance of the forced binary‐answer format for the measurement of evaluative beliefs, and thus challenges current measurement practice among academics and practitioners.\",\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'The human lens nucleus is formed in utero, and from birth onwards, there appears to be no significant turnover of intracellular proteins or membrane components. Since, in adults, this region also lacks active enzymes, it offers the opportunity to examine the intrinsic stability of macromolecules under physiological conditions. Fifty seven human lenses, ranging in age from 12 to 82 years, were dissected into nucleus and cortex, and the nuclear lipids analyzed by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. In the first four decades of life, glycerophospholipids (with the exception of lysophosphatidylethanolamines) declined rapidly, such that by age 40, their content became negligible. In contrast the level of ceramides and dihydroceramides, which were undetectable prior to age 30, increased approximately 100-fold. The concentration of sphingomyelins and dihydrosphingomyelins remained unchanged over the whole life span. As a consequence of this marked alteration in composition, the properties of fiber cell membranes in the centre of young lenses are likely to be very different from those in older lenses. Interestingly, the identification of age 40 years as a time of transition in the lipid composition of the nucleus coincides with previously reported macroscopic changes in lens properties (e.g., a massive age-related increase in lens stiffness) and related pathologies such as presbyopia. The underlying reasons for the dramatic change in the lipid profile of the human lens with age are not known, but are most likely linked to the stability of some membrane lipids in a physiological environment.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'Previous studies noted significant health and behavioural problems in cattle accommodated on fully slatted floors. As the majority of beef bulls in Austria are still housed on fully slatted floors the development of alternative housing systems becomes vitally important. On the basis of behavioural analyses, we wanted to test the suitability of alternative housing systems under on-farm conditions. Data was collected on seven Austrian farms between January 2006 and April 2007. The resting, social and sexual behaviour of 219 Simmental bulls accommodated in four different housing systems was observed for 48 h at an average live weight of 450 kg and 600 kg using continuous and scan sampling method. The studied housing systems were (a) fully concrete slatted floor pens (CS), (b) fully slatted floor pens covered with rubber mats (RS), (c) straw bedded pens (ST) and (d) a system combining straw bedded pens (for bulls weighing less than 450 kg) and fully slatted floor pens (for bulls weighing more than 450 kg), (SS). The number of lying (P > 0.001) and short standing bouts (P < 0.001) was significantly higher in ST and RS than in CS and the mean duration of lying bouts significantly lower (P < 0.001). Bulls in ST showed less atypical lying down movements and difficulties to stand up than bulls in the other systems (P < 0.001). The number of lying down intentions was significantly lower in ST and RS than in CS (P < 0.001). Moreover, we found a significantly lower mean duration of lying down (P = 0.005) and standing up (P < 0.001) in ST than in CS and SS. It is concluded that rubber mats for slatted floors have a positive effect on the bulls’ behaviour but do not reach the welfare potential of straw bedding.',\n",

Here, a general class of Rasch mixture models is established and implemented in R, using conditional maximum likelihood estimation of the item parameters (given the raw scores) along with flexible specification of two model building blocks: (1) Mixture weights for the unobserved classes can be treated as model parameters or based on covariates in a concomitant variable model. (2) The distribution of raw score probabilities can be parametrized in two possible ways, either using a saturated model or a specification through mean and variance. The function raschmix() in the R package psychomix provides these models, leveraging the general infrastructure for fitting mixture models in the flexmix package.

This method is independent of rigid model forms or other link functions. It may be applied both to metric and non-metric data as well as to independent or matched parallel samples. With this method identification of the most relevant biomarkers is not based on inferential methods; therefore, its application does not require corrections of the level of significance, even in cases of thousands of variables. Hence, the introduced method is appropriate to analyze and evaluate data of complex investigations in clinical and pre-clinical basic research, such as gene or protein expressions, phenotype-genotype associations in case-control studies on the basis of thousands of genes and SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphism), search of prevalence in sleep EEG-Data, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or others.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'Data-driven market segmentation is a popular and widely used segmentation method in tourism. It aims to identify market segments among tourists who are similar to each other, thus allowing a targeted marketing mix to be developed. Typically data used to segment tourists are characterized by small numbers of respondents and large numbers of survey questions. Small samples and numerous questions cause serious methodological problems that have typically been addressed by using factor-cluster analysis to reduce the dimensionality of data. Recently, factor-cluster analysis has been shown as an unacceptable solution to the problem of high data dimensionality in segmentation. In this article, the authors introduce biclustering, a novel approach to address the problem of high dimensionality in tourism segmentation studies. We discuss the circumstances in which biclustering should be used rather than parametric or nonparametric grouping techniques. An illustrative example of how biclustering is computed is also provided.',\n",

For collections of data sets, the empirical performance distributions of a set of learning algorithms are estimated, compared, and ordered. Usually this is done for each data set separately. The present manuscript extends this single data set-based approach to a joint analysis for the complete collection, the so called problem domain. This enables to decide which algorithms to deploy in a specific application or to compare newly developed algorithms with well-known algorithms on established problem domains. Specialized visualization methods allow for easy exploration of huge amounts of benchmark data. Furthermore, we take the benchmark experiment design into account and use mixed-effects models to provide a formal statistical analysis. Two domain-based benchmark experiments demonstrate our methods: the UCI domain as a well-known domain when one is developing a new algorithm; and the Grasshopper domain as a domain where we want to find the  best learning algorithm for a prediction component in an enterprise application software system.',\n",

Market researchers thus face the challenge of recruiting respondents, increasing response rates and reducing respondent fatigue by making questionnaires as short and pleasant as possible. One way of achieving this is to replace traditionally used ordinal multi-category answer formats (such as Likert-type scales) with forced binary scales. This proposition is attractive only if it indeed shortens the survey time while not compromising the quality of managerial insights from the data. This study investigates these conditions. Results from a repeat-measurement design indicate that managerial interpretations do not differ substantially between the two answer formats, responses are equally reliable, and that the binary format is quicker and perceived as less complex.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'This paper answers key questions about personal and industry decision-making in implementing sustainable tourism. Being environmentally friendly is typically associated with sacrifice, including sacrifice of comfort (e.g. walking rather than driving), sacrifice of time (e.g. recycling garbage) or sacrifice of money (e.g. buying more expensive locally grown vegetables). Consequently, the tourism industry perceives sustainable tourism as a sacrificial touristic niche, one that is associated with additional cost but appears to attract customers who do not spend enough money to compensate for the extra effort. This paper explores a perceived trade-off between minimising environmental damage and maximising revenue, by finding market segments that are environmentally friendly and have high expenditures. An online survey was made of 1003 Australian domestic tourists. Results indicate that tourist segments vary significantly in terms of their environmental impacts and vacation expenditure. Six segments were identified. Two market segments, containing 40% of the total market, that leave small environmental footprints while maintaining high expenditure were found, indicating that market segmentation when coupled with marketing/demarketing policies can be used as a strategy complementary to the development of destination-based initiatives to reduce the environmental impact of tourism.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'Background Several DNA microarray based expression signatures for the different clinically relevant thyroid tumor entities have been described over the past few years. However, reproducibility of these signatures is generally low, mainly due to study biases, small sample sizes and the highly multivariate nature of microarrays. While there are new technologies available for a more accurate high throughput expression analysis, we show that there is still a lot of information to be gained from data deposited in public microarray databases. In this study we were aiming (1) to identify potential markers for papillary thyroid carcinomas through meta analysis of public microarray data and (2) to confirm these markers in an independent dataset using an independent technology. Methods We adopted a meta analysis approach for four publicly available microarray datasets on papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) nodules versus nodular goitre (NG) from N2-frozen tissue. The methodology included merging of datasets, bias removal using distance weighted discrimination (DWD), feature selection/inference statistics, classification/crossvalidation and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). External Validation was performed on an independent dataset using an independent technology, quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) in our laboratory. Results From meta analysis we identified one gene (SERPINA1) which identifies papillary thyroid carcinoma against benign nodules with 99% accuracy (n = 99, sensitivity = 0.98, specificity = 1, PPV = 1, NPV = 0.98). In the independent validation data, which included not only PTC and NG, but all major histological thyroid entities plus a few variants, SERPINA1 was again markedly up regulated (36-fold, p = 1:3*10-10) in PTC and identification of papillary carcinoma was possible with 93% accuracy (n = 82, sensitivity = 1, specificity = 0.90, PPV = 0.76, NPV = 1). We also show that the extracellular matrix pathway is strongly activated in the meta analysis data, suggesting an important role of tumor-stroma interaction in the carcinogenesis of papillary thyroid carcinoma. Conclusions We show that valuable new information can be gained from meta analysis of existing microarray data deposited in public repositories. While single microarray studies rarely exhibit a sample number which allows robust feature selection, this can be achieved by combining published data using DWD. This approach is not only efficient, but also very cost-effective. Independent validation shows the validity of the results from this meta analysis and confirms SERPINA1 as a potent mRNA marker for PTC in a total (meta analysis plus validation) of 181 samples.',\n",

We found a nominally significant association between gender and harm avoidance (P=0.017; women showing higher scores). There was no association of either DAT1, DRD3 or 5HT2A alleles or genotypes with any dimension of the TCI applying Kruskal–Wallis rank-sum tests. Comparing homozygote and heterozygote DAT1 genotypes, we found higher novelty seeking scores in homozygotes (P=0.054). We further found a nominally significant interaction between DAT1 and 5HT2A homo-/heterozygous gene variants (P=0.0071; DAT1 and 5HT2A genotypes P value of 0.05), performing multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Examining the temperamental TCI subscales, this interaction was associated with persistence (genotypes: P=0.004; homo-/heterozygous gene variants: P=0.0004).

As the majority of beef bulls in Austria are still housed on fully slatted floors the development of alternative housing systems becomes vitally important. On the basis of behavioural analyses, we wanted to test the suitability of alternative housing systems under on-farm conditions. Data was collected on seven Austrian farms between January 2006 and April 2007. The resting, social and sexual behaviour of 219 Simmental bulls accommodated in four different housing systems was observed for 48 h at an average live weight of 450 kg and 600 kg using continuous and scan sampling method. The studied housing systems were (a) fully concrete slatted floor pens (CS), (b) fully slatted floor pens covered with rubber mats (RS), (c) straw bedded pens (ST) and (d) a system combining straw bedded pens (for bulls weighing less than 450 kg) and fully slatted floor pens (for bulls weighing more than 450 kg), (SS). The number of lying (P > 0.001) and short standing bouts (P < 0.001) was significantly higher in ST and RS than in CS and the mean duration of lying bouts significantly lower (P < 0.001). Bulls in ST showed less atypical lying down movements and difficulties to stand up than bulls in the other systems (P < 0.001). The number of lying down intentions was significantly lower in ST and RS than in CS (P < 0.001). Moreover, we found a significantly lower mean duration of lying down (P = 0.005) and standing up (P < 0.001) in ST than in CS and SS. It is concluded that rubber mats for slatted floors have a positive effect on the bulls’ behaviour but do not reach the welfare potential of straw bedding.',\n",

Both can be measured with high-throughput microarrays and some methodologies to integrate and analyze these data exist. However, varying gene sets within different gene expression and copy number microarrays present significant challenges. Results We report an advanced version of earlier published CGH-Plotter that rapidly can identify amplified and deleted areas using gene copy number data. With CGH-Plotter v2, the copy number values can be filtered based on the genomic location in basepair units. After filtering, the values for the missing genes can be interpolated. Moreover, the effect of non-informative areas in the genome can be systematically removed by smoothing and interpolating. Further, we developed a tool (ECN) to illustrate the CGH-data values annotated based on the gene expression. The ECN-tool is a MATLAB toolbox enabling straightforward illustration of copy numbers annotated based on the gene expression levels. Conclusion CGH-Plotter v2 provides two methods for analyzing copy number data; dynamic programming and genomic location based smoothing. With ECN-tool the data analyzed with CGH-Plotter v2 can easily be illustrated along the chromosomes individually or along the whole genome.

This study contributes to this gap by investigating whether individuals who feel morally obliged to behave in an environmentally friendly manner represent useful target segments for destination management aiming to improve the ecological sustainability of the local tourism industry. Results indicate that distinctly different moral obligation segments exist that differ in pro-environmental behavior and attitudes.

       "  {'abstract': 'From observations of intra-specific social grooming in cattle and studies on human stroking in other species, we hypothesised that cows’ reactions to human stroking differ depending on the body regions being stroked. Moreover, we tested, whether cows ‘reactions to stroking change with the animals’ experience of stroking. Sixty dairy cows were stroked in three different body regions, i.e. the withers, W, neck ventral, NV (both licked often in social grooming) and the lateral chest, LC (licked rarely), in a balanced order during 10-min sessions. Behavioural reactions and heart rate during stroking as well as reactions to the human just after stroking were recorded. Two test sessions were carried out with 3 weeks of treatment in-between. During this period, the cows were randomly allocated to four treatment groups: three groups received 5 min of daily stroking in either W, NV or LC and the last one (control group) was exposed to simple human presence. During stroking W and NV, cows showed longer neck stretching and ear hanging than during stroking LC (P < 0.001). Moreover, ear hanging was shown longer when W was stroked as compared to NV (P < 0.001), but neck stretching was observed longer during stroking NV as compared to W only after the treatment period (P < 0.01). In the first test session, more animals showed head shaking and head throwing during stroking W and NV than LC (P < 0.01), whereas in the second test session these behaviours were observed only in few animals. In the first test session heart rate was higher during stroking W than the other body regions (P ≤ 0.01). In the second test session, the lowest heart rate was found during stroking NV (P < 0.05). Finally, contact with the experimenter following stroking differed for the three body regions stroked in both test sessions (first: P = 0.06, second: P < 0.01); contact was shortest for LC. When comparing both test sessions, stretching the neck and ear hanging increased (P < 0.001), while head shaking and head throwing decreased (P < 0.05); there was no difference for heart rate and contact with the experimenter. The four treatments had no influence on reactions to stroking. To conclude, stroking of body regions often licked during social grooming led to more responses than stroking the one licked rarely. Some reactions, such as stretching the neck, are also observed during social licking. This suggests that cows may in part perceive human stroking of body regions often licked similarly to social licking. This knowledge could be of interest for an improvement in quality of human–cattle interactions.',\n",

In this paper we propose diagnostic tools to check for identifiability problems based on the fact that they induce multiple (global) modes in the distribution of the parameterizations of the maximum likelihood models depending on the data generating process. The parametric bootstrap is used to approximate this distribution. In order to investigate the presence of multiple (global) modes the congruence between the results of information-based methods based on asymptotic theory and those derived using the models fitted to the bootstrap samples with initalization in the solution as well as random initialization is assessed. The methods are illustrated using a finite mixture of Gaussian regression models on data from a study on spread of viral infection.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': \"Infections of unknown origin and an altered immune response have been hypothesized to play a role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. We have previously identified two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the IL-10 receptor 1 (IL-10R1) causing a substitution of glycine 330 to arginine (G330R) and of serine 138 to glycine (S138G). A possible association between these IL-10R1 variants and schizophrenia has been investigated in the present study. DNA of 101 unrelated Austrian patients with a DSM-III-R (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) consensus diagnosis of schizophrenia (n\\u2009=\\u200970) or schizoaffective disorder (n\\u2009=\\u200931) and DNA of 121 German schizophrenic patients (DSM-III-R) was analyzed for the presence of S138G and G330R by allele-specific multiplex PCRs. Data from patients were compared with 250 unrelated, psychiatric healthy controls. No difference in allele frequency was detected between patients and controls (G330R: 34.0% vs. 30.0%, P\\u2009=\\u20090.208; S138G: 19.7% vs. 16.6%, P\\u2009=\\u20090.235; by Fisher's exact test). However, there was a significant difference in genotype distribution (wt/wt, wt/mut, mut/mut) for G330R between patients (46.8%, 38.3%, 14.9%) and controls (47.6%, 44.8%, 7.6%; Fisher's test P\\u2009=\\u20090.032). No such difference was seen for S138G. Our results suggest that homozygosity of the IL-10R1 G330R allele is associated with schizophrenia and may contribute to the expression of disease phenotype in susceptible individuals.\",\n",

Hippocampal gene expression profiling of eight different mouse strains points towards strain-specific regulation of genes involved in neuronal information storage. Protein expression with regard to strain- dependent expression of structures related to neuronal information storage has not been investigated yet. Herein, a proteomic approach based on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF) has been chosen to address this question by determining strain-dependent expression of proteins involved in neurotransmission and activity-induced actin remodelling in hippocampal tissue of five mouse strains. Of 31 spots representing 16 different gene products analysed and quantified, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein-α, actin-like protein 3, profilin and cofilin were expressed in a strain-dependent manner. By treating protein expression as a phenotype, we have shown significant genetic variation in brain protein expression. Further experiments in this direction may provide an indication of the genetic elements that contribute to the phenotypic differences between the selected strains through the expressional level of the translated protein. In view of this, we propose that proteomic analysis enabling to concomitantly survey the expression of a large number of proteins could serve as a valuable tool for genetic and physiological studies of central nervous system function.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'Software development has become an important part of management science, although often only “behind the scenes”. More and more papers present results that are based on complicated simulations or numerical techniques and the percentage of research related to computations is continuously increasing. Although many researchers would never call themselves “software developers” they spend considerable amounts of time programming simulation studies or writing a prototype implementation of a new al- gorithm to be able to benchmark it against the state-of-the-art. Reproducibility of results and incremental development by reuse of available knowledge have been two of the main principles of science throughout the centuries. If we want to make the computational aspects of management science adhere to these principles, open source software can help a lot. To reproduce tables and figures which are the result of complicated computations, a superficial description of how the results were obtained is in many cases not sufficient to reproduce them. In fact, often only the code used to obtain the results will allow others to verify them. Proposing a new data analytic technique in a paper without providing a reference implementation of the algorithm means that everybody who wants to try the method has to reinvent the wheel by reimplementation. Providing code as proprietary software is much better than nothing, but hinders incremental improvements because it is hard to try modifications of existing techniques. The success of open source software projects like the Linux operating system or the R environment for statistical computing are based on the fact that anybody can and may improve the existing code. Obviously closed source code cannot be part of the scientific output if computations shall be reviewed by the scientific community, hence convenient tools for distributing scientific open source software are needed. R provides both a comprehensive environment for data analysis as well as the mechanism to easily share methodology via its packaging system.',\n",

In practice, benchmark studies are a tool to compare the performance of several competing algorithms for a certain learning problem. Cross-validation or resampling techniques are commonly used to derive point estimates of the performances which are compared to identify algorithms with good properties. For several benchmarking problems, test procedures taking the variability of those point estimates into account have been suggested. Most of the recently proposed inference procedures are based on special variance estimators for the cross-validated performance. We introduce a theoretical framework for inference problems in benchmark experiments and show that standard statistical test procedures can be used to test for differences in the performances. The theory is based on well-defined distributions of performance measures which can be compared with established tests. To demonstrate the usefulness in practice, the theoretical results are applied to regression and classification benchmark studies based on artificial and real world data.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'Inbred mouse strains have different genetic backgrounds that can result in impairment of synaptic plasticity and memory. Strain-dependent performance in behavioral and cognitive tasks is well-documented. Hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), an activity-dependent enhancement of synaptic transmission that may underlie some forms of learning and memory has been shown to differ significantly between inbred mouse strains. However, an effect of strain on the expression of proteins, critically involved in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory has not been described yet. We have been addressing this question by determining expressional levels of a panel of proteins involved in neuronal information processing in hippocampus of five mouse strains by immunoblotting. Four inbred strains (FVB/N, C57Bl/6J, 129S2/Sv and Balb/c), commonly used for generating genetically modified mice and for conventional experiments in pharmacology and toxicology and one outbred strain (OF1) have been selected. A significant effect of strain was detected for total and phosphorylated calcium-calmodulin dependent kinase IIalpha (CaMKII, pCaMKII), phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase (pMAPK), total and phosphorylated calcium-responsive element binding 1 (creb, pcreb), early-growth response protein 1 (egr 1), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), drebrin and postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95). These results may indicate genetic determination of synaptic plasticity-related mechanisms relevant for the molecular events mediating hippocampal information processing and storage. Data presented herein highlight the importance of careful selection of the mouse strain for studies of synaptic plasticity.',\n",

Method: Eighty-one patients with bulimia nervosa were randomly assigned to either a self-help manual with a maximum of 18 short weekly visits (guided self-help) or to 18 weekly 1.5-h sessions of cognitive-behavioral group therapy (CBT). The primary outcome variables were monthly frequencies of self-reported binge eating and vomiting episodes. Secondary outcome variables were eating disorder-related psychopathology (assessed with the Eating Disorders Inventory [EDI]) and depression (assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory [BDI]). Patients were followed up 1 year after the end of treatment. Results: A mixed-effects linear regression analysis indicated that subjects in both treatment conditions showed a significant decrease over time in binge eating and vomiting frequencies, in the scores of the EDI subscales, and in the BDI. Both treatment modalities led to a sustained improvement at follow-up. A separate analysis of the completer sample showed significantly higher remission rates in the self-help condition (74%) compared with the CBT condition (44%) at follow-up. Conclusions: Guided self-help incorporating the use of a self-help manual offers an approach that can be effective in the short and long-term treatment of bulimia nervosa.',\n",

Using the same family sample (five pedigrees with schizophrenic index patients and three pedigrees with index bipolar disorder patients N=86; 50 of them were available for genotyping), genotyping of eight additional markers close to D3S1265 was done. Five of those new markers (three centromeric and two telomeric of D3S1265) spanning 4.14 cM (centiMorgan) could be used for statistical analyses (“new markers”). Moreover, marker D3S1265, genotyped within the published genome scan, was used for additional calculations. Linkage analysis was performed using the GENEHUNTER program version 2.1r3. Within newly genotyped markers the highest NPL score Zall observed was 1.93296 with the telomeric SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) rs1835669, corresponding to P=0.032166. Statistical analysis including D3S1265, located in between the newly genotyped markers, resulted in a peak NPL score Zall=4.00179 with marker D3S1265, that is P=0.000128. Doing subset analyses of the bipolar disorder and schizophrenia families separately with new markers and D3S1265, linkage signals arose substantially from bipolar disorder families, with contribution from schizophrenia families, too.

The number of reports published on a posteriori market segmentation studies has rapidly increased since Haley’s milestone publication on benefit segmentation in 1968.

       "  {'abstract': 'Background: Despite the widely accepted view that schizophrenia and bipolar disorder represent independent illnesses and modes of inheritance, some data in the literature suggest that the diseases may share some genetic susceptibility. The objective of our analyses was to search for vulnerability loci for the two disorders. Methods: A genomewide map of 388 microsatellite DNA markers was genotyped in five schizophrenia and three bipolar disorder Austrian families. Linkage analyses was used to compute the usual parametric logarithm of the likelihood of linkage (LOD) scores and nonparametric linkage analysis (NPL scores Z(all)) was used to assess the pattern of allele sharing at each marker locus relative to the presence of the disease (GENEHUNTER). Affected status was defined as severe affective disorder or schizophrenia. Results: Across the genome, p values associated with NPL scores resulted in evidence (i.e., p <.0007) for linkage at marker D3S1265 on chromosome 3q (NPL score Z (all) = 3.74, p =.0003). Two other markers (on 3q and 6q) showed p values of <.01. Conclusions: We detected a potential susceptibility locus for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia on chromosome 3q, which has not been reported previously. The possibility of a false positive result has to be taken into account. Our data suggest shared loci for schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorders and are consistent with the continuum model of psychosis.',\n",

Methods: Over a period of 12 months (June 1994 to May 1995) we recruited patients consecutively admitted to our psychiatric university outpatient clinic in a prospective study. All patients were diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, revised 4th edition. A total of 344 patients presented themselves with a diagnosis of affective disorder. Out of these, 36 were diagnosed as having SAD. From the same group of 344 patients, we selected a matched control group of 36 patients suffering from NSMD. The experimental and control groups were matched according to sex, age, severity of illness and number of siblings. Results: There was no significant difference concerning the lifetime prevalences for psychiatric disorders among the fist-degree relatives in both groups (SAD = 16.5% and NSMD = 19%). Conclusion: It seems that there is no difference in familiarity for psychiatric disorders between SAD and NSMD.',\n",

Evidence from various studies has clearly demonstrated that genetic factors contribute substantially to the etiology. The goal of this study was to identify chromosomal regions likely to contain schizophrenia susceptibility genes. Methods: A genome-wide map of 388 microsatellite DNA markers was genotyped in 5 schizophrenia families. Nonparametric linkage analysis (Genehunter) was used to assess the pattern of allele sharing at each marker locus relative to the presence of disease. Results: Nonparametric linkage scores did not reach a genome-wide level of statistical significance (p < 0.00002) or a p value suggestive of linkage (p < 0.007) for any marker; however, one p value suggested replicated linkage (p < 0.01) at chromosome 6p24 in region D6S309 (p = 0.0047). Furthermore, 11 markers resulted in p < 0.05 at chromosomes 6p, 6q, 10q, 12q and 14q. Conclusions: Despite the differences in diagnostic schemes, in markers used and methods of analyses between studies published so far, we think that our result supports the notion that there is possibly some consistent evidence for replicated linkage of a schizophrenia susceptibility locus around the region of D6S309 at chromosome 6p24.',\n",

Therefore, we studied candidate genes in a sample of unrelated patients (n = 102) and healthy controls (n = 79) of Austrian origin, searching for a possible association between polymorphic DNA markers of 5 candidate genes (serotonin transporter, 5-HTT; serotonin 2a receptor, 5-HT2a; dopamine D2 receptor, DRD2; dopamine D3 receptor, DRD3; dopamine transporter, DAT1) and bipolar disorder. There was an association between allelic and genotypic frequencies of 5-HTT and affection status (p = 0.014 and p = 0.017, respectively). However, after correction for multiple comparisons (Bonferroni), these results did not remain significant. Nevertheless, the findings might suggest that alterations in the structure of 5-HTT are involved in the pathogenesis of bipolar disorder, which could have major implications in treatment. No association between 5-HT2a, DRD2, DRD3, DAT1 and bipolar disorder was found.',\n",

If all the characteristic roots are outside the unit circle, then the process is ergodic and stationary. If at least one characteristic root lies inside the unit circle, then the process is transient. AR-NN processes with characteristic roots lying on the unit circle exhibit either ergodic, random walk, or transient behavior. We also analyze the class of integrated AR-NN (ARI-NN) processes and show that a standardized ARI-NN process “converges” to a Wiener process. Finally, least-squares estimation (training) of the stationary models and testing for nonstationarity is discussed. The estimators are shown to be consistent, and expressions on the limiting distributions are given.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'Evaluating new methods and algorithms in unsupervised learning obviously requires thorough benchmarking studies on data sets that most closely reflect performance in actual usage. Designing data sets that do exactly that is quite a challenging task in itself; standing up to the challenge in comparison to other methods is another point which poses a risk of compromising the goal of an objective benchmarking study. We want to address the latter by proposing a framework that standardizes the format of artificial data, or rather its metadata. We intend to introduce a web repository that functions as an exchange for metadata of artificial data and an accompanying R package that can generate actual data from the descriptions obtained from the repository. It is therefore much simpler to find data designed by others and which has been used in previous benchmarking studies. This removes some of the temptation to specifically design artificial data in a way so that a proposed method performs significantly better than existing ones, a claim that might not hold in real life applications.',\n",

One key aspect of this framework is the design specification: we use a format based on the Extendible Markup Language (XML) that is simple-structured yet still enables the design of flexible models. Another issue in agent-based simulations, especially when ready-made components are used, is the heterogeneity arising from both the agents' implementations and the underlying platforms. To tackle such obstacles, we introduce a wrapper technique for mapping the functionality of agents living in an interpreter-based environment to a standardized JAVA interface, thus facilitating the task for any control mechanism (like a simulation manager) because it has to handle only one set of commands for all agents involved. Again, this mapping is made by an XML-based definition format. We demonstrate the technique by applying it to a simple sample simulation of two mass marketing firms operating in an artificial consumer environment.\",\n",

       "  {'abstract': \"Recently, different research groups reported conflicting results with regard to an association of dopamine 4 receptor (DRD4) genotypes and the personality dimension of novelty seeking (NS). High scores for NS seemed to be associated with long alleles of a DRD4 polymorphism. Furthermore, an association between personality traits and the dopamine 2 (DRD2) receptor gene was reported. NS and persistence (PS) high scores seemed to be associated with alleles of DRD2. We examined 109 (78 female and 31 male) normal healthy individuals using Cloninger's Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) in order to replicate these findings. We genotyped a 48 base pair variable number of tandem repeats (from two to eight repeats) polymorphism in the third exon of DRD4 and a Cys311Ser polymorphism in exon 7 of DRD2. We tested alleles and genotypes of DRD4 (allele 7 absent or present; genotype 4,4 versus 4,7), and Ser/Cys and Cys/Cys genotypes of DRD2 for associations with TCI values. NS and the alleles and genotypes of DRD4 did not show any association. In associating the genotypes of DRD2 with TCI scales (NS, harm avoidance, reward dependence and PS), we also found no association. Recent findings associating NS with DRD4 could not be replicated. With regard to DRD2, we tested a different polymorphism as published recently and could not find an association of TCI scales with the gene. The present results therefore do not provide evidence that the DRD2 and DRD4 receptor genes contribute a common and relevant effect to personality traits.\",\n",

The case study uses demographic data to illustrate cultural factors intervening in the social organisation of an Austrian village in the period 1700-1900. Two sets of potential intervening variables that might explain the effects of culture on demographic behaviour were investigated: population policies through normative regulations and institutional changes due to shifts in government. The paper employs statistical techniques in a structural change setting for evaluating the impact of policies and institutional changes on the demographic development. There is clear evidence that normative interventions concerning the fraction of illegitimate births and the marriage pattern were effective.',\n",
