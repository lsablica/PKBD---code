        "abstract": "Glyphosate is the most widely used active ingredient (AI) in thousands of glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) worldwide. Short-term impacts of AIs or GBHs on earthworms are well known, but few studies have examined long-term legacy effects &gt;3 months after application. In a pot experiment, we studied both short-term and long-term effects on deep burrowing earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris) and soil functions. Therefore, the cover crop Sinapis alba was grown in soils with either 3.0% or 4.1% soil organic matter content (SOM) and either sprayed with a GBH (Touchdown Quattro, Roundup PowerFlex, or Roundup LB Plus) or the respective glyphosate AI (diammonium-, potassium-, or isopropylamine-salt) or hand weeded (control). Long-term effects showed increased earthworm activity under GBHs even 4 months after application, but similar activity under AIs and control. Another application of the same treatments 5 months after the previous one also increased earthworm activity under GBHs, especially at high SOM levels. Water infiltration after a simulated heavy rainfall was 50% lower, and leaching was 30% higher under GBH than under AI application or hand weeding. Individual GBHs and AIs varied in their effects and were influenced by SOM and soil moisture. Full disclosure of all ingredients in GBH formulations would be necessary to allow a comprehensive assessment of environmental risks.",

        "title": "The role of unpaid domestic work in explaining the gender gap in the (monetary) value of leisure",
        "abstract": "The value of travel time savings (VTTS) representing the willingness to pay to reduce travel time, consists of two components: the value of liberating time [equal to the value of leisure (VoL)] and the value of time assigned to travel (VTAT), representing the travel conditions of a trip. Their relative values indicate which dimension to emphasize when investing in transport: speed or comfort. In this paper, we formulate and estimate a framework aimed at the improvement in the estimation of the VoL. By introducing a novel treatment of time assigned to domestic work, we consider that unpaid labor should be assigned a wage rate as a measure of the expenses avoided when assigning time to those chores. We use state-of-the-art data on time use and expenses as well as online data on gig workers collected in Austria, and apply the time-use and expenditure model of Jara-Diaz et al. (Transp Res Part B 42(10):946\u2013957, 2008). The wage rates for paid and unpaid work were combined to re-formulate the budget constraint, which affected women more than men due to the higher involvement of the former in domestic activities. Compared against the original estimation, the VoL changed from \u20ac10/h for men and \u20ac6/h for women to \u20ac9/h for both genders, which in turn yields a larger average VTAT, which becomes positive for public transport. As a conclusion, the novel treatment of domestic labor contributes to closing the gap in the VoL between genders and highlights the power of unveiling the components behind the VTTS. The empirical findings imply that investments in travel time reductions rather than in comfort should be prioritized, given the very good conditions of public transport in Austria.",

        "abstract": "The production of synthetic pesticides is energy intensive and can emit even more greenhouse gases (GHG) per kg than the production of synthetic fertilizers. However, this aspect is largely neglected when it comes to agriculture\u2019s contribution to GHG emissions. Using official pesticide sales data from Austria from 2000 to 2019, we analyzed (i) trends in insecticide, fungicide, and herbicide use and calculated production-related GHG emissions, and (ii) the share of pesticide-related versus fertilizer-related GHG emissions in three agricultural crops with different pesticide intensities: sugar beets, apples, and grapevines. We found that between 2000 and 2019, insecticide amounts increased by 58%, fungicide amounts increased by 29%, and herbicide amounts decreased by 29%; associated GHG emissions showed similar patterns. During the same period, acreage under conventional arable crops, orchards, and vineyards decreased by an average of 19%, indicating an increase in management intensity. In intensive apple production, GHG emissions associated with pesticide production and application accounted for 51% of total GHG emissions, in viticulture 37%, and in sugar beets 12%. We have shown that GHG emissions due to pesticide production and application can be significant, especially for pesticide-intensive crops. We therefore recommend that these pesticide-derived GHG emissions should also be attributed to the agricultural sector.",

        "abstract": "\n                Background\n                Pesticide use has been associated with risks for human health and an overall decline in biodiversity. Although herbicides are the most commonly used pesticides worldwide, they have received less attention in this debate. We investigated the extent to which long-term trends in herbicide use in Austria influence potential toxic exposures to non-target organisms and potential risks to humans. We analyzed official sales data of 101 herbicide active ingredients (AIs) approved in Austria between 2010 and 2019 regarding their ecotoxicological properties based on lethal doses (LD50 and LC50) weighed by their persistence in the environment (DT50) for honeybees (Apis mellifera), earthworms (Eisenia fetida), and birds (Serinus serinus). Human health risks were qualitatively assessed based on official hazard statements for the AIs used.\n              \n                Results\n                In Austria, herbicide amounts sold decreased significantly by 24% from 1480 to 1123 tonnes between 2010 and 2019. This also led to a considerable decrease in the amounts of AIs classified by H-statements of the EU Pesticides Database: \u2212\u00a071% acute inhalation toxicity, \u2212\u00a058% reproductive toxicity,\u2212\u00a047% specific target organ toxicity. Yet, 36% of herbicides used were still classified as highly hazardous pesticides according to the Pesticide Action Network. Surprisingly, over the same period, toxic loads to honeybees increased by 487% (oral exposure), while lethal toxic loads to earthworms increased by 498%, and to birds by 580%. This can be attributed to a shift toward the use of more acutely toxic and especially more persistent AIs. The most problematic AI for honeybees, earthworms, birds and humans was the highly persistent diquat. The further ranking of the most toxic herbicides varied considerably depending on the organism. It is important to note that this toxic load assessment, like official environmental risk assessments, evaluates the potential risk but not the actual fatalities or real-world exposure.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                Our results show a trade-off between herbicide amounts and toxicological hazards to humans and other non-target organisms. These interdependencies need to be considered when implementing pesticide reduction targets to protect public health and biodiversity, such as the EU\u00b4s \u201cfarm-to-fork\u201d strategy, which aims to reduce the amounts and risks of synthetic pesticides.\n              ",

        "abstract": "The invasive Spanish slug (Arion vulgaris) is an important pest species in agriculture and horticulture in Europe. In the last decades it has spread across the continent where it outcompetes native slug and snail species, thus posing a threat for biodiversity. A popular anecdote suggests to promote Roman snails (Helix pomatia) in gardens because they are able to controlA. vulgaris. We examined a potential interrelationship between these two species using a mesocosm experiment with lettuce plants.13C-15N stable isotope labelling of lettuce allowed us to investigate interactions betweenHelixandArionon weight gain/loss and herbivory. Additionally, we wanted to know whether different watering regimes (daily vs. every 3rd day watering of weekly amount) and earthworms alter these interactions. Egg predation ofHelixonArioneggs was further tested in a food-choice experiment.Arionshowed a five times higher herbivory per body mass thanHelixin a single-species setting. However, in mesocosms containing both species percentage of herbivory per body mass was significantly lower than inArion-only mesocosms, especially when watered every three days. Overall isotope uptake via eaten lettuce was unaffected by the presence of the other species. Only very little predation (three out of 200 eggs) ofHelixonArioneggs was observed. Our results provide no evidence for a clear dismissal or confirmation of the popular gardener\u2019s anecdote thatHelixsnails have a negative effect onArionabundance or herbivory.",

        "abstract": "Wildlife-related accidents, especially deer-vehicle accidents, pose a serious problem for road safety and animal protection in many countries. Knowledge of spatial and temporal patterns of deer-vehicle accidents is inevitable for accident analysis and mitigation efforts with temporal deer-vehicle accident data being much more difficult to obtain in sufficient data quality. We described the temporal patterns of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) roadkills occurring in the period 2002\u20132006 in southeastern Austria. Using a comprehensive dataset, consisting of 11.771 data points, we examined the influence of different time units (i.e. season, month, day of week, day of year), illumination categories (coarse and fine temporal resolution) and lunar phases on deer-vehicle accidents by performing linear and generalized additive models. Thereby, we identified peak accident periods within the analyzed time units. Highest frequencies of deer-vehicle accidents occurred in November, May and October, on Fridays, and during nights. Relationships between lunar phases and roe deer-vehicle accidents were analysed, providing evidence for high frequencies of deer-vehicle accidents during full moon phases. We suggest that deer-vehicle accidents are dependent both on human activity in traffic and wildlife activity, which is in turn affected by phenology, intra- and interspecific competition, climatic and astronomical events. Our results highlight, that short-term mitigation measures (e.g. traffic controls and speed limits) can be highly effective to reduce deer-vehicle accidents, but should be flexibly adapted to specific temporal periods.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundGlyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) are among the most often used pesticides. The hundreds of GBHs used worldwide consist of the active ingredient (AI) glyphosate in form of different salts, possibly other AIs, and various mostly undisclosed co-formulants. Pesticide risk assessments are commonly performed using single AIs or GBHs at standard soil conditions without vegetation. In a greenhouse experiment, we established a weed population with common amaranth (Amaranthus retroflexus)to examine the effects of three GBHs (Roundup LB Plus, Roundup PowerFlex, Touchdown Quattro) and their corresponding AIs (salts of glyphosate isopropylammonium, potassium, diammonium) on the activity and physiological biomarkers (glutathione S-transferase, GST; acetylcholine esterase, AChE) of an ecologically relevant earthworm species (Lumbricus terrestris). GBHs and AIs were applied at recommended doses; hand weeding served as control. Experiments were established with two soil types differing in organic matter content (SOM; 3.0% vs. 4.1%) and other properties.ResultsEarthworm activity (casting and movement activity) decreased after application of glyphosate formulations or active ingredients compared to hand weeding. We found no consistent pattern that formulations had either higher or lower effects on earthworm activity than their active ingredients; rather, differences were substance-specific. Earthworm activity was little affected by soil organic matter levels. Biomarkers remained unaffected by weed control types; GST but not AChE was decreased under high SOM. Water infiltration after a simulated heavy rainfall was interactively affected by weed control types and SOM. Leachate amount was higher after application of formulations than active ingredients and was higher under low SOM. Glyphosate concentrations in soil and leachate were strongly affected by application of formulations or active ingredients and varied with SOM (significant weed control type x SOM interaction).ConclusionsWe found that both commercial formulations and pure active ingredients can influence earthworms with consequences on important soil functions. Glyphosate products showed increased, reduced or similar effects than pure glyphosate on particular soil functions; soil properties can substantially alter this. Especially at lower SOM, heavy rainfalls could lead to more glyphosate leaching into water bodies. A full disclosure of co-formulants would be necessary to further decipher their specific contributions to these inconsistent effects.",

        "abstract": "Immunocompromised patients are predisposed to chronically infected wounds. Especially ulcers in the dorsal region often experience secondary polymicrobial infections. However, current wound infection models mostly use single-strain bacteria. To mimic clinically occurring infections caused by fecal contamination in immunocompromised/immobile patients, which differ significantly from single-strain infections, the present study aimed at the establishment of a new mouse model using infection by fecal bacteria. Dorsal circular excision wounds in immunosuppressed mice were infected with fecal slurry solution in several dilutions up to 1:8,000. Impact of immunosuppressor, bacterial load and timing on development of wound infections was investigated. Wounds were analyzed by scoring, 3D imaging and swab analyses. Autofluorescence imaging was not successful. Dose-finding of cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppression was necessary for establishment of bacterial wound infections. Infection with fecal slurry diluted 1:166 to 1:400 induced significantly delayed wound healing (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.05) without systemic reactions. Swab analyses post-infection matched the initial polymicrobial suspension. The customized wound score confirmed significant differences between the groups (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.05). Here we report the establishment of a simple, new mouse model for clinically occurring wound infections by fecal bacteria and the evaluation of appropriate wound analysis methods. In the future, this model will provide a suitable tool for the investigation of complex microbiological interactions and evaluation of new therapeutic approaches.",

While the subcellular distribution of proteins is well studied in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, this is not the case for other yeasts like Komagataella phaffii (syn. Pichia pastoris). Different to most well-studied yeasts, K. phaffii can grow on methanol, which provides specific features for production of heterologous proteins and as a model for peroxisome biology. We isolated microsomes, very early Golgi, early Golgi, plasma membrane, vacuole, cytosol, peroxisomes and mitochondria of K. phaffii from glucose- and methanol-grown cultures, quantified their proteomes by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry of either unlabeled or tandem mass tag-labeled samples. Classification of the proteins by their relative enrichment, allowed the separation of enriched proteins from potential contaminants in all cellular compartments except the peroxisomes.

Moreover, it is largely unknown to what extent different soil characteristics alter potential side effects of herbicides. We conducted a greenhouse experiment growing a model weed population of Amaranthus retroflexus in arable field soil with either 3.0 or 4.1% soil organic matter (SOM) content and treated these weeds either with GBHs (Roundup LB Plus, Touchdown Quattro, Roundup PowerFlex) or their respective AIs (isopropylammonium, diammonium or potassium salts of glyphosate) at recommended dosages. Control pots were mechanically weeded. Nontarget effects were assessed on the surface activity of the springtail species Sminthurinus niger (pitfall trapping) and litter decomposition in the soil (teabag approach). Both GBHs and AIs increased the surface activity of springtails compared to control pots; springtail activity was higher under GBHs than under corresponding AIs. Stimulation of springtail activity was much higher in soil with higher SOM content than with low SOM content (significant treatment x SOM interaction). Litter decomposition was unaffected by GBHs, AIs or SOM levels. We suggest that ERAs for pesticides should be performed with actually applied herbicides rather than only on AIs and should also consider influences of different soil properties.",

Although it is simple and fast, as its name suggests, it nonetheless has neglected local optima and empty clusters that may arise. With the distance as an input to the algorithm, a generalized distance function is developed to increase the variation of the distances, especially for a mixed variable dataset. The variation of the distances is a crucial part of a partitioning algorithm due to different distances producing different outcomes. The experimental results of the simple k-medoids algorithm produce consistently good performances in various settings of mixed variable data. It also has a high cluster accuracy compared to other distance-based partitioning algorithms for mixed variable data.",

        "abstract": "Regulatory recommendations for quality by design instead of\u00a0quality by testing raise increasing interest in new sensor technologies. An online monitoring system for downstream processes is developed, which is based on an array of online detectors. Besides standard detectors (UV, pH, and conductivity), our chromatographic workstation is equipped with a fluorescence and a mid\u2010infrared spectrometer, a light scattering, and a refractive index detector. The combination of these sensors enables the prediction of specific protein concentration and various purity attributes, such as high molecular weight impurities, DNA and host cell protein content during the elution phase of a chromatographic antibody capture process. Prediction models solely based on online signals are set up providing real\u2010time predictions. No mechanistic models or information about the chromatographic runs is used. These predictions allow online pooling decisions replacing time\u2010 and labor\u2010intensive laboratory measurements. Different process variations, such as changes in the column load or elution buffer, are introduced to test the predictive power of the models. Extrapolation of the models worked well when the column load is changed, whereas model adjustment is necessary when the elution conditions are changed considerably.",

The goal is to ensure the quality of the final product. Currently, chromatographic processes in biopharmaceutical production are predominantly monitored with UV/Vis absorbance and a direct correlation with purity and quantity is limited. In this study, a chromatographic workstation was equipped with additional online sensors, such as multi\u2010angle light scattering, refractive index, attenuated total reflection Fourier\u2010transform infrared, and fluorescence spectroscopy. Models to predict quantity, host cell proteins (HCP), and double\u2010stranded DNA (dsDNA) content simultaneously were developed and exemplified by a cation exchange capture step for fibroblast growth factor 2 expressed in Escherichia coliOnline data and corresponding offline data for product quantity and co\u2010eluting impurities, such as dsDNA and HCP, were analyzed using boosted structured additive regression. Different sensor combinations were used to achieve the best prediction performance for each quality attribute. Quantity can be adequately predicted by applying a small predictor set of the typical chromatographic workstation sensor signals with a test error of 0.85 mg/ml (range in training data: 0.1\u201328 mg/ml). For HCP and dsDNA additional fluorescence and/or attenuated total reflection Fourier\u2010transform infrared spectral information was important to achieve prediction errors of 200 (2\u20136579 ppm) and 340 ppm (8\u20133773 ppm), respectively.",

A pre\u2010requirement for their use in industrial production of biopharmaceuticals is to be clonal, thus originating from a single cell in order to be phenotypically and genomically identical. In the present study it was evaluated whether standard procedures, such as the generation of a recombinant cell line in combination with selection for a specific and stable phenotype (expression of the recombinant product) or subcloning have any impact on karyotype stability or homogeneity in CHO cells. Analyses used were the distribution of chromosome counts per cell as well as chromosome painting to identify specific karyotype patterns within a population. Results indicate that subclones both of the host and the recombinant cell line are of comparable heterogeneity and (in)stability as the original pool. In contrast, the rigorous selection for a stably expressing phenotype generated cell lines with fewer variation and more stable karyotypes, both at the level of the sorted pool and derivative subclones. We conclude that the process of subcloning itself does not contribute to an improved karyotypic homogeneity of a population, while the selection for a specific cell property inherently can provide evolutionary pressure that may lead to improved chromosomal stability as well as to a more homogenous population.",

Few methods exist to assess such genome wide instability. Here, we use the population distribution of chromosome numbers per cell as well as chromosome painting to quantify the karyotypic variation in several CHO host cell lines. CHO\u2010S, CHO\u2010K1 8\u2009mM glutamine, and CHO\u2010K1 cells adapted to grow in media containing no glutamine were analyzed over up to 6 months in culture. All three cell lines were clearly distinguishable by their chromosome number distribution and by the specific chromosome rearrangements that were present in each population. Chromosome Painting revealed a predominant karyotype for each cell line at the start of the experiment, completed by a large number of variants present in each population. Over time in culture, the predominant karyotype changed for CHO\u2010S and CHO\u2010K1, with the diversity increasing and new variants appearing, while CHO\u2010K1 0\u2009mM Gln preferred chromosome pattern increased in percent of the population over time.

Many individuals think about foster caring long before they actually become carers, and it stands to reason that in many cases, carer discontinuation also follows a period of ideation. This being the case, it is possible that by monitoring ideation, interventions could be introduced to prevent placement disruptions occurring, particularly if the sources of dissatisfaction are known. Using a sample of 205 foster carers, a posteriori segmentation analysis identifies groups of carers dissatisfied with the same aspects of their role. One group is particularly dissatisfied with factors that are within the control of foster care agencies and also reports high levels of discontinuation ideation. Recommendations include that the individual support needs of carers be identified such that customized support can be offered, including boosting initial and ongoing training to manage expectations and ensure carers feel prepared for the role. Results also highlight the important role of caseworkers in making carers feel appreciated and taken seriously.",

        "abstract": "The quality of biopharmaceuticals and patients' safety are of highest priority and there are tremendous efforts to replace empirical production process designs by knowledge\u2010based approaches. Main challenge in this context is that real\u2010time access to process variables related to product quality and quantity is severely limited. To date comprehensive on\u2010 and offline monitoring platforms are used to generate process data sets that allow for development of mechanistic and/or data driven models for real\u2010time prediction of these important quantities. Ultimate goal is to implement model based feed\u2010back control loops that facilitate online control of product quality. In this contribution, we explore structured additive regression (STAR) models in combination with boosting as a variable selection tool for modeling the cell dry mass, product concentration, and optical density on the basis of online available process variables and two\u2010dimensional fluorescence spectroscopic data. STAR models are powerful extensions of linear models allowing for inclusion of smooth effects or interactions between predictors. Boosting constructs the final model in a stepwise manner and provides a variable importance measure via predictor selection frequencies. Our results show that the cell dry mass can be modeled with a relative error of about \u00b13%, the optical density with \u00b16%, the soluble protein with \u00b116%, and the insoluble product with an accuracy of \u00b112%.

The major challenges in this context are the fragmentary understanding of bioprocesses and the severely limited real\u2010time access to process variables related to product quality and quantity. Data driven modeling of process variables in combination with model predictive process control concepts represent a potential solution to these problems. The selection of statistical techniques best qualified for bioprocess data analysis and modeling is a key criterion. In this work a series of recombinant Escherichia coli fed\u2010batch production processes with varying cultivation conditions employing a comprehensive on\u2010 and offline process monitoring platform was conducted. The applicability of two machine learning methods, random forest and neural networks, for the prediction of cell dry mass and recombinant protein based on online available process parameters and two\u2010dimensional multi\u2010wavelength fluorescence spectroscopy is investigated. Models solely based on routinely measured process variables give a satisfying prediction accuracy of about \u00b1 4% for the cell dry mass, while additional spectroscopic information allows for an estimation of the protein concentration within \u00b1 12%. The results clearly argue for a combined approach: neural networks as modeling technique and random forest as variable selection tool.",

        "abstract": "ObjectivesCognitive behavioural guided self\u2010help has been shown to be effective in mild and moderate depressive disorder. It is not known, however, if it is effective in individuals with partially remitted depressive disorder, which is a serious clinical problem in up to 50\u201360% of treated patients. This study is the first one to examine the clinical benefit of this intervention in this patient population.DesignFor the purpose of this study, a single\u2010blind, randomized controlled design was used.MethodWe randomized 90 individuals with partially remitted depressive disorder either to cognitive behavioural guided self\u2010help plus psychopharmacotherapy (n\u00a0=\u00a049) or psychopharmacotherapy alone (n\u00a0=\u00a041). They were clinically assessed at regular intervals with ratings of depressive symptoms and stress\u2010coping strategies over a 3\u2010week run\u2010in period and a 6\u2010week treatment period.ResultsAfter 6\u00a0weeks, intention\u2010to\u2010treat analysis (n\u00a0=\u00a090) showed that patients treated with cognitive behavioural guided self\u2010help plus psychopharmacotherapy did not have significantly lower scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale of Depression (17\u2010item version; HRSD\u201017) and on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) compared to patients treated with psychopharmacotherapy alone. When negative stress\u2010coping strategies were considered, there was a significant difference between the two groups at the end of treatment with respect to the BDI but not to the HRSD\u201017.ConclusionsGuided self\u2010help did not lead to a significant reduction in symptom severity in patients with partially remitted depressive disorder after a 6\u2010week intervention. However, the intervention leads to a reduction of negative stress\u2010coping strategies. Cognitive behavioural guided self\u2010help did not significantly improve depressive symptoms measured with the Hamilton Rating Scale of Depression (17\u2010item version; HRSD\u201017) in patients with partially remitted depressive disorder. Improvements were found in reducing negative stress\u2010coping strategies for those allocated to the cognitive behavioural guided self\u2010help, which significantly improved Beck Depression Inventory but not HRSD\u201017. These findings suggest that cognitive behavioural guided self\u2010help may offer some assistance in managing negative stress\u2010coping strategies.",

Within academic research alone, approximately 5% of published articles use market segmentation. However, the validity of data-driven market segmentation analyses depends on having available a sample of adequate size. Moreover, no guidance exists for determining what an adequate sample size is. In the present simulation study using artificial data of known structure, the impact of the difficulty of the segmentation task on the required sample size is analyzed in dependence of the number of variables in the segmentation base. Under all simulated data circumstances, a sample size of 70 times the number of variables proves to be adequate. This finding is of substantial practical importance because it will provide guidance to data analysts in academia and industry who wish to conduct reliable and valid segmentation studies.",

In fact, 65% of marketing managers admit to having difficulties with the interpretation of data-driven market segmentation solutions. In this study we develop novel ways of visualising segmentation solutions using graphical statistics methodology. The proposed plots help academics and practitioners to interpret complex market segmentation solutions, thus improving the practical usability of market segmentation, reducing the risk of misinterpretation and contributing to closing the much-lamented \u2018theory\u00e2\u20ac\u201cpractice divide\u2019 in market segmentation.

        "abstract": "PurposeAcademic researchers love multi\u2010category answer formats, especially five\u2010 and seven\u2010point formats. More than a decade ago Josef Mazanec concluded that these formats may not the best choice, and that simple binary\u2010answer options are preferable in some empirical survey contexts. The purpose of the present study is to investigate empirically Mazanec's hypothesis in the context of the measurement of evaluative beliefs relating to fast\u2010food restaurants. Design/methodology/approachThe authors conducted an online experiment that asked respondents to assess evaluative beliefs relating to fast\u2010food brands using either a forced binary (n=100) or a seven\u2010point answer format (n=100). The authors also measured preferences for each of the fast\u2010food restaurants, user friendliness, and recorded the actual completion times for the survey.FindingsThe results indicate that the full binary answer format outperforms the popular seven\u2010point multi\u2010category format with respect to stability, concurrent validity, and speed of completion. Practical implicationsGiven the demonstrated strengths of full binary measures, they should be used more by both practitioners and academics when measuring evaluative beliefs. Originality/valueThis study provides empirical evidence of the strong performance of the forced binary\u2010answer format for the measurement of evaluative beliefs, and thus challenges current measurement practice among academics and practitioners.",

        "abstract": " Data-driven market segmentation is a popular and widely used segmentation method in tourism. It aims to identify market segments among tourists who are similar to each other, thus allowing a targeted marketing mix to be developed. Typically data used to segment tourists are characterized by small numbers of respondents and large numbers of survey questions. Small samples and numerous questions cause serious methodological problems that have typically been addressed by using factor-cluster analysis to reduce the dimensionality of data. Recently, factor-cluster analysis has been shown as an unacceptable solution to the problem of high data dimensionality in segmentation. In this article, the authors introduce biclustering, a novel approach to address the problem of high dimensionality in tourism segmentation studies. We discuss the circumstances in which biclustering should be used rather than parametric or nonparametric grouping techniques. An illustrative example of how biclustering is computed is also provided. ",

For collections of data sets, the empirical performance distributions of a set of learning algorithms are estimated, compared, and ordered. Usually this is done for each data set separately. The present manuscript extends this single data set-based approach to a joint analysis for the complete collection, the so called problem domain. This enablesto decide which algorithms to deploy in a specific application or to compare newly developed algorithms with well-known algorithms on established problem domains.Specialized visualization methods allow for easy exploration of huge amounts of benchmark data. Furthermore, we take the benchmark experiment design into account and use mixed-effects models to provide a formal statistical analysis. Two domain-based benchmark experiments demonstrate our methods: the UCI domain as a well-known domain when one is developing a new algorithm; and the Grasshopper domain as a domain where we want to find the\u00a0 best learning algorithm for a prediction component in an enterprise application software system.",

The component-specific parameters in the regression models are estimated using regularized likelihood methods. The advantages of the regularization are that (i) the pre-specified maximum degrees of freedom for the splines is less crucial than for unregularized estimation and that (ii) for each component individually a suitable degree of freedom is selected in an automatic way. The performance is evaluated in a simulation study with artificial data as well as on a yeast cell cycle dataset of gene expression levels over time.\n               Availability: The latest release version of the R package flexmix is available from CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org/).\n               Contact: \u00a0Bettina.Gruen@jku.at",

        "abstract": " Consumers are increasingly saturated by market research, which leads to decreasing response rates and an increased danger of response bias. Market researchers thus face the challenge of recruiting respondents, increasing response rates and reducing respondent fatigue by making questionnaires as short and pleasant as possible. One way of achieving this is to replace traditionally used ordinal multi-category answer formats (such as Likert-type scales) with forced binary scales. This proposition is attractive only if it indeed shortens the survey time while not compromising the quality of managerial insights from the data. This study investigates these conditions. Results from a repeat-measurement design indicate that managerial interpretations do not differ substantially between the two answer formats, responses are equally reliable, and that the binary format is quicker and perceived as less complex.

Inferential analysis on a cluster solution is used to judge its ability to provide insight into the underlying mechanistic biology of the experiment.\n          ",

        "abstract": "\n          \n            Background\n            R is the leading open source statistics software with a vast number of biostatistical and bioinformatical analysis packages. To exploit the advantages of R, extensive scripting/programming skills are required.\n          \n          \n            Results\n            We have developed a software tool called R GUI Generator (RGG) which enables the easy generation of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) for the programming language R by adding a few Extensible Markup Language (XML) \u2013 tags. RGG consists of an XML-based GUI definition language and a Java-based GUI engine. GUIs are generated in runtime from defined GUI tags that are embedded into the R script. User-GUI input is returned to the R code and replaces the XML-tags. RGG files can be developed using any text editor. The current version of RGG is available as a stand-alone software (RGGRunner) and as a plug-in for JGR.\n          \n          \n            Conclusion\n            RGG is a general GUI framework for R that has the potential to introduce R statistics (R packages, built-in functions and scripts) to users with limited programming skills and helps to bridge the gap between R developers and GUI-dependent users. RGG aims to abstract the GUI development from individual GUI toolkits by using an XML-based GUI definition language. Thus RGG can be easily integrated in any software. The RGG project further includes the development of a web-based repository for RGG-GUIs. RGG is an open source project licensed under the Lesser General Public License (LGPL) and can be downloaded freely at http://rgg.r-forge.r-project.org",

        "abstract": " The environmental sustainability of the local tourism industry is increasingly a concern. Authors have proposed a demand-driven approach to sustainable destination management as complementary to traditional supply-side interventions. However, little empirical evidence supports the feasibility of such a demand-driven approach. This study contributes to this gap by investigating whether individuals who feel morally obliged to behave in an environmentally friendly manner represent useful target segments for destination management aiming to improve the ecological sustainability of the local tourism industry. Results indicate that distinctly different moral obligation segments exist that differ in pro-environmental behavior and attitudes. These segments are associated with distinctly different vacation preferences and can consequently be used by destination management for target marketing. Gaps between people's pro-environmental behavior at home and at the destination systematically differ across segments, leading to the conclusion that different combinations of demand and supply-side measures may be suitable to reduce the environmental footprint of different segments.

        "abstract": "Infections of unknown origin and an altered immune response have been hypothesized to play a role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. We have previously identified two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the IL\u201010 receptor 1 (IL\u201010R1) causing a substitution of glycine 330 to arginine (G330R) and of serine 138 to glycine (S138G). A possible association between these IL\u201010R1 variants and schizophrenia has been investigated in the present study. DNA of 101 unrelated Austrian patients with a DSM\u2010III\u2010R (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) consensus diagnosis of schizophrenia (n\u2009=\u200970) or schizoaffective disorder (n\u2009=\u200931) and DNA of 121 German schizophrenic patients (DSM\u2010III\u2010R) was analyzed for the presence of S138G and G330R by allele\u2010specific multiplex PCRs. Data from patients were compared with 250 unrelated, psychiatric healthy controls. No difference in allele frequency was detected between patients and controls (G330R: 34.0% vs. 30.0%, P\u2009=\u20090.208; S138G: 19.7% vs. 16.6%, P\u2009=\u20090.235; by Fisher's exact test). However, there was a significant difference in genotype distribution (wt/wt, wt/mut, mut/mut) for G330R between patients (46.8%, 38.3%, 14.9%) and controls (47.6%, 44.8%, 7.6%; Fisher's test P\u2009=\u20090.032). No such difference was seen for S138G. Our results suggest that homozygosity of the IL\u201010R1 G330R allele is associated with schizophrenia and may contribute to the expression of disease phenotype in susceptible individuals. \u00a9 2006 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc.",

Hippocampal gene expression profiling of eight different mouse strains points towards strain\u2010specific regulation of genes involved in neuronal information storage. Protein expression with regard to strain\u2010 dependent expression of structures related to neuronal information storage has not been investigated yet. Herein, a proteomic approach based on two\u2010dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry (MALDI\u2010TOF/TOF) has been chosen to address this question by determining strain\u2010dependent expression of proteins involved in neurotransmission and activity\u2010induced actin remodelling in hippocampal tissue of five mouse strains. Of 31 spots representing 16 different gene products analysed and quantified, N\u2010ethylmaleimide\u2010sensitive fusion protein, N\u2010ethylmaleimide\u2010sensitive factor attachment protein\u2010\u03b1, actin\u2010like protein 3, profilin and cofilin were expressed in a strain\u2010dependent manner. By treating protein expression as a phenotype, we have shown significant genetic variation in brain protein expression. Further experiments in this direction may provide an indication of the genetic elements that contribute to the phenotypic differences between the selected strains through the expressional level of the translated protein. In view of this, we propose that proteomic analysis enabling to concomitantly survey the expression of a large number of proteins could serve as a valuable tool for genetic and physiological studies of central nervous system function.

Here we consider a wide array of fluctuation\u2010type tests in a monitoring situation\u2014given a history period for which a regression relationship is known to be stable, we test whether incoming data are consistent with the previously established relationship. Procedures based on estimates of the regression coefficients are extended in three directions: we introduce (a) procedures based on OLS residuals, (b) rescaled statistics and (c) alternative asymptotic boundaries. Compared to the existing tests our extensions offer ease of computation, improved size in finite samples for dynamic models and better power against certain alternatives, respectively. We apply our methods to three data sets, German M1 money demand, US labour productivity and S&amp;P 500 stock returns. Copyright \u00a9 2005 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",

        "abstract": "ObjectiveThe aim of the current study was to evaluate whether guided self\u2010help was effective in the short and long term in the treatment of bulimia nervosa.MethodEighty\u2010one patients with bulimia nervosa were randomly assigned to either a self\u2010help manual with a maximum of 18 short weekly visits (guided self\u2010help) or to 18 weekly 1.5\u2010h sessions of cognitive\u2010behavioral group therapy (CBT). The primary outcome variables were monthly frequencies of self\u2010reported binge eating and vomiting episodes. Secondary outcome variables were eating disorder\u2010related psychopathology (assessed with the Eating Disorders Inventory [EDI]) and depression (assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory [BDI]). Patients were followed up 1 year after the end of treatment.ResultsA mixed\u2010effects linear regression analysis indicated that subjects in both treatment conditions showed a significant decrease over time in binge eating and vomiting frequencies, in the scores of the EDI subscales, and in the BDI. Both treatment modalities led to a sustained improvement at follow\u2010up. A separate analysis of the completer sample showed significantly higher remission rates in the self\u2010help condition (74%) compared with the CBT condition (44%) at follow\u2010up.ConclusionsGuided self\u2010help incorporating the use of a self\u2010help manual offers an approach that can be effective in the short and long\u2010term treatment of bulimia nervosa. \u00a9 2004 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "abstract": "Market segmentation is a very popular and broadly accepted way of increasing profitability. The number of reports published on a posteriori market segmentation studies has rapidly increased since Haley\u2019s milestone publication on benefit segmentation in 1968. Nevertheless, it is common practice to use a single segmentation base only and to run a single calculation of a single algorithm, which dramatically increases the chance of building an entire marketing plan on a random solution of the algorithm chosen. The application presented constructs winter vacation styles based on guest survey data, avoiding both weaknesses mentioned before. Through the replicative framework provided by bagged clustering, potentially suboptimal random solutions are avoided. Independent partitioning of vacation activities and travel motives leads to more holistic segments. By looking for over and underrepresentation of all combinations of the behavioral and psychographic segmentation, vacation styles are identified and studied in detail.",

We show that the typical seasonal volatility in high\u2010frequency data can be accounted for by transforming the underlying time scale.

Evidence from various studies has clearly demonstrated that genetic factors contribute substantially to the etiology. The goal of this study was to identify chromosomal regions likely to contain schizophrenia susceptibility genes. &lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt; A genome-wide map of 388 microsatellite DNA markers was genotyped in 5 schizophrenia families. Nonparametric linkage analysis (Genehunter) was used to assess the pattern of allele sharing at each marker locus relative to the presence of disease. &lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt; Nonparametric linkage scores did not reach a genome-wide level of statistical significance (p &lt; 0.00002) or a p value suggestive of linkage (p &lt; 0.007) for any marker; however, one p value suggested replicated linkage (p &lt; 0.01) at chromosome 6p24 in region D6S309 (p = 0.0047). Furthermore, 11 markers resulted in p &lt; 0.05 at chromosomes 6p, 6q, 10q, 12q and 14q. &lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt; Despite the differences in diagnostic schemes, in markers used and methods of analyses between studies published so far, we think that our result supports the notion that there is possibly some consistent evidence for replicated linkage of a schizophrenia susceptibility locus around the region of D6S309 at chromosome 6p24.",

        "title": "Association Studies of Candidate Genes in Bipolar Disorders",
        "abstract": "The aim of the investigation was to test genes for predisposition to bipolar affective disorder. Therefore, we studied candidate genes in a sample of unrelated patients (n = 102) and healthy controls (n = 79) of Austrian origin, searching for a possible association between polymorphic DNA markers of 5 candidate genes (serotonin transporter,&lt;i&gt; 5-HTT;&lt;/i&gt; serotonin 2a receptor, &lt;i&gt;5-HT2a;&lt;/i&gt; dopamine D2 receptor, &lt;i&gt;DRD2; &lt;/i&gt;dopamine D3 receptor, &lt;i&gt;DRD3;&lt;/i&gt; dopamine transporter, &lt;i&gt;DAT1&lt;/i&gt;) and bipolar disorder. There was an association between allelic and genotypic frequencies of &lt;i&gt;5-HTT&lt;/i&gt; and affection status (p = 0.014 and p = 0.017, respectively). However, after correction for multiple comparisons (Bonferroni), these results did not remain significant. Nevertheless, the findings might suggest that alterations in the structure of &lt;i&gt;5-HTT&lt;/i&gt; are involved in the pathogenesis of bipolar disorder, which could have major implications in treatment. No association between &lt;i&gt;5-HT2a, DRD2, DRD3, DAT1&lt;/i&gt; and bipolar disorder was found.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we introduce the generalized fluctuation \ntest for monitoring structural changes and establish a \nresult characterizing the limiting behavior of this class \nof tests. As applications of the generalized fluctuation \ntest, tests based on the maximum and range of the fluctuation \nof moving estimates are proposed. We also derive the boundary \nfunctions for the proposed tests and tabulate simulated \ncritical values. Our simulations indicate that these tests \ncompare favorably with the recursive-estimates-based test \nconsidered by Chu, Stinchcombe, and White (1996, Econometrica \n64, 1045\u20131065) when a change occurs late.",

        "abstract": " We consider autoregressive neural network (AR-NN) processes driven by additive noise and demonstrate that the characteristic roots of the shortcuts\u2014the standard conditions from linear time-series analysis\u2014determine the stochastic behavior of the overall AR-NN process. If all the characteristic roots are outside the unit circle, then the process is ergodic and stationary. If at least one characteristic root lies inside the unit circle, then the process is transient. AR-NN processes with characteristic roots lying on the unit circle exhibit either ergodic, random walk, or transient behavior. We also analyze the class of integrated AR-NN (ARI-NN) processes and show that a standardized ARI-NN process \u201cconverges\u201d to a Wiener process. Finally, least-squares estimation (training) of the stationary models and testing for nonstationarity is discussed. The estimators are shown to be consistent, and expressions on the limiting distributions are given. ",
